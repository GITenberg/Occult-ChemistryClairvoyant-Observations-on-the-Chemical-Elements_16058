  <p>When undertaking to prepare a new edition of this book I received
  permission from the authors to "throw it into the form in which you think
  it would be most useful at the present time." It was left to my
  discretion, "What to use and what to omit." I have not found it necessary
  to avail myself to any considerable extent of this latter permission. But
  as the contents of the book were originally arranged the reader was
  ill-prepared to appreciate the importance of the later research for want
  of introductory matter explaining how it began, and how the early
  research led up to the later investigation. I have therefore contributed
  an entirely new preliminary chapter which will, I hope, help the reader
  to realise the credibility of the results attained when the molecular
  forms and constitution of the numerous bodies examined were definitely
  observed. I have not attempted to revise the records of the later
  research in which I had no personal share, so from the beginning of
  Chapter III to the end the book in its present form is simply a reprint
  of the original edition except for the correction of a few trifling
  misprints.</p>

  <p>I have thus endeavoured to bring into clear prominence at the outset
  the scientific value of the light the book sheds on the constitution of
  matter. The world owes a debt to scientific men of the ordinary type that
  cannot be over-estimated, but though they have hitherto preferred to
  progress gradually, from point to point, disliking leaps in the dark, the
  leap now made is only in the dark for those who will not realise that the
  progress to be accomplished by means of instrumental research must sooner
  or later be supplemented by subtler methods. Physical science has reached
  the conception that the atoms of the bodies hitherto called the chemical
  elements are each composed of minor atoms. Instrumental research cannot
  determine by how many, in each case. Occult research ascertained the
  actual number in some cases by direct observation and then discovered the
  law governing the numbers in all cases, and the relation of these numbers
  to atomic weights. The law thus unveiled is a demonstration of the
  accuracy of the first direct observations, and this principle once
  established the credibility of accounts now given as to the arrangement
  of minor atoms in the molecules of the numerous elements examined, seems
  to me advanced to a degree approximating to proof.</p>

  <p>It remains to be seen&mdash;not how far, but rather how soon the
  scientific world at large will accept the conclusions of this volume as a
  definite contribution to science, blending the science of the laboratory
  with that variety that has hitherto been called occult.</p>

<h2>OCCULT CHEMISTRY.</h2>

<h3>CHAPTER I.</h3>

<h3>A PRELIMINARY SURVEY.</h3>

  <p>The deep interest and importance of the research which this book
  describes will best be appreciated if introduced by an account of the
  circumstances out of which it arose. The first edition, consisting mainly
  of articles reprinted from the <i>Theosophist</i>, dealt at once with the
  later phases of the research in a way which, though intelligible to the
  occult student, must have been rather bewildering to the ordinary reader.
  These later phases, however, endow the earlier results with a
  significance that in the beginning could only be vaguely conjectured. I
  am the better entitled to perform the task that has been assigned to
  me&mdash;that of preparing the present edition&mdash;by reason of the
  fact that it was in my presence and at my instigation that the first
  efforts were made to penetrate the mystery previously enshrouding the
  ultimate molecule of matter.</p>

  <p>I remember the occasion vividly. Mr. Leadbeater was then staying at my
  house, and his clairvoyant faculties were frequently exercised for the
  benefit of myself, my wife and the theosophical friends around us. I had
  discovered that these faculties, exercised in the appropriate direction,
  were ultra-microscopic in their power. It occurred to me once to ask Mr.
  Leadbeater if he thought he could actually <i>see</i> a molecule of
  physical matter. He was quite willing to try, and I suggested a molecule
  of gold as one which he might try to observe. He made the appropriate
  effort, and emerged from it saying the molecule in question was far too
  elaborate a structure to be described. It evidently consisted of an
  enormous number of some smaller atoms, quite too many to count; quite too
  complicated in their arrangement to be comprehended. It struck me at once
  that this might be due to the fact that gold was a heavy metal of high
  atomic weight, and that observation might be more successful if directed
  to a body of low atomic weight, so I suggested an atom of hydrogen as
  possibly more manageable. Mr. Leadbeater accepted the suggestion and
  tried again. This time he found the atom of hydrogen to be far simpler
  than the other, so that the minor atoms constituting the hydrogen atom
  were countable. They were arranged on a definite plan, which will be
  rendered intelligible by diagrams later on, and were eighteen in
  number.</p>

  <p>We little realized at the moment the enormous significance of this
  discovery, made in the year 1895, long before the discovery of radium
  enabled physicists of the ordinary type to improve their acquaintance
  with the "electron." Whatever name is given to that minute body it is
  recognised now by ordinary science as well as by occult observation, as
  the fundamental unit of physical matter. To that extent ordinary science
  has overtaken the occult research I am dealing with, but that research
  rapidly carried the occult student into regions of knowledge whither, it
  is perfectly certain, the ordinary physicist must follow him at no
  distant date.</p>

  <p>The research once started in the way I have described was seen to be
  intensely interesting. Mrs. Besant almost immediately co-operated with
  Mr. Leadbeater in its further progress. Encouraged by the success with
  hydrogen, the two important gases, oxygen and nitrogen, were examined.
  They proved to be rather more difficult to deal with than hydrogen but
  were manageable. Oxygen was found to consist of 290 minor atoms and
  nitrogen of 261. Their grouping will be described later on. The interest
  and importance of the whole subject will best be appreciated by a rough
  indication of the results first attained. The reader will then have more
  patience in following the intricacies of the later discoveries.</p>

  <p>The figures just quoted were soon perceived to have a possible
  significance. The atomic weight of oxygen is commonly taken as 16. That
  is to say, an atom of oxygen is sixteen times heavier than an atom of
  hydrogen. In this way, all through the table of atomic weights, hydrogen
  is taken as unity, without any attempt being made to estimate its
  absolute weight. But now with the atom of hydrogen dissected, so to
  speak, and found to consist of 18 somethings, while the atom of oxygen
  consisted of 290 of the same things, the sixteen to one relationship
  reappears: 290 divided by 18 gives us 16 and a minute decimal fraction.
  Again the nitrogen number divided by 18 gives us 14 and a minute fraction
  as the result, and that is the accepted atomic weight of nitrogen. This
  gave us a glimpse of a principle that might run all through the table of
  atomic weights. For reasons having to do with other work, it was
  impossible for the authors of this book to carry on the research further
  at the time it was begun. The results already sketched were published as
  an article in the magazine then called <i>Lucifer</i>, in November, 1895,
  and reprinted as a separate pamphlet bearing the title "Occult
  Chemistry," a pamphlet the surviving copies of which will one day be a
  recognised vindication of the method that will at some time in the future
  be generally applied to the investigation of Nature's mysteries. For the
  later research which this volume deals with does establish the principle
  with a force that can hardly be resisted by any fair-minded reader. With
  patience and industry&mdash;the authors being assisted in the counting in
  a way that will be described (and the method adopted involved a check
  upon the accuracy of the counting)&mdash;the minor atoms of almost all
  the known chemical elements, as they are commonly called, were counted
  and found to bear the same relation to their atomic weights as had been
  suggested by the cases of oxygen and nitrogen. This result throws back
  complete proof on the original estimate of the number of minor atoms in
  hydrogen, a figure which ordinary research has so far entirely failed to
  determine. The guesses have been widely various, from unity to many
  hundreds, but, unacquainted with the clairvoyant method, the ordinary
  physicist has no means of reaching the actual state of the facts.</p>

  <p>Before going on with the details of the later research some very
  important discoveries arising from the early work must first be
  explained. As I have already said clairvoyant faculty of the appropriate
  order directed to the minute phenomena of Nature is practically infinite
  in its range. Not content with estimating the number of minor atoms in
  physical molecules, the authors proceeded to examine the minor atoms
  individually. They were found to be themselves elaborately complicated
  structures which, in this preliminary survey of the whole subject, I will
  not stop to explain (full explanation will be found later on) and they
  are composed of atoms belonging to an ultra-physical realm of Nature with
  which the occultist has long been familiar and describes as "the Astral
  Plane." Some rather pedantic critics have found fault with the term, as
  the "plane" in question is of course really a sphere entirely surrounding
  the physical globe, but as all occultists understand the word, "plane"
  simply signifies a condition of nature. Each condition, and there are
  many more than the two under consideration, blends with its neighbour,
  <i>via</i> atomic structure. Thus the atoms of the Astral plane in
  combination give rise to the finest variety of physical matter, the ether
  of space, which is not homogeneous but really atomic in its character,
  and the minute atoms of which physical molecules are composed are atoms
  of ether, "etheric atoms," as we have now learned to call them.</p>

  <p>Many physicists, though not all, will resent the idea of treating the
  ether of space as atomic. But at all events the occultist has the
  satisfaction of knowing that the great Russian chemist, Mendeleef,
  preferred the atomic theory. In Sir William Tilden's recent book entitled
  "Chemical Discovery and Invention in the Twentieth Century," I read that
  Mendeleef, "disregarding conventional views," supposed the ether to have
  a molecular or atomic structure, and in time all physicists must come to
  recognise that the Electron is not, as so many suppose at present, an
  atom of electricity, but an atom of ether carrying a definite unit charge
  of electricity.</p>

  <p>Long before the discovery of radium led to the recognition of the
  electron as the common constituent of all the bodies previously described
  as chemical elements, the minute particles of matter in question had been
  identified with the cathode rays observed in Sir William Crookes' vacuum
  tubes. When an electric current is passed through a tube from which the
  air (or other gas it may contain) has been almost entirely exhausted, a
  luminous glow pervades the tube manifestly emanating from the cathode or
  negative pole of the circuit. This effect was studied by Sir William
  Crookes very profoundly. Among other characteristics it was found that,
  if a minute windmill was set up in the tube before it was exhausted, the
  cathode ray caused the vanes to revolve, thus suggesting the idea that
  they consisted of actual particles driven against the vanes; the ray
  being thus evidently something more than a mere luminous effect. Here was
  a mechanical energy to be explained, and at the first glance it seemed
  difficult to reconcile the facts observed with the idea creeping into
  favour, that the particles, already invested with the name "electron,"
  were atoms of electricity pure and simple. Electricity was found, or
  certain eminent physicists thought they had found, that electricity
  <i>per se</i> had inertia. So the windmills in the Crookes' vacuum tubes
  were supposed to be moved by the impact of electric atoms.</p>

  <p>Then in the progress of ordinary research the discovery of radium by
  Madame Curie in the year 1902 put an entirely new face upon the subject
  of electrons. The beta particles emanating from radium were soon
  identified with the electrons of the cathode ray. Then followed the
  discovery that the gas helium, previously treated as a separate element,
  evolved itself as one consequence of the disintegration of radium.
  Transmutation, till then laughed at as a superstition of the alchemist,
  passed quietly into the region of accepted natural phenomena, and the
  chemical elements were seen to be bodies built up of electrons in varying
  number and probably in varying arrangements. So at last ordinary science
  had reached one important result of the occult research carried on seven
  years earlier. It has not yet reached the finer results of the occult
  research&mdash;the <i>structure</i> of the hydrogen atom with its
  eighteen etheric atoms and the way in which the atomic weights of all
  elements are explained by the number of etheric atoms entering into their
  constitution.</p>

  <p>The ether of space, though defying instrumental examination, comes
  within scope of the clairvoyant faculty, and profoundly interesting
  discoveries were made during what I have called the early research in
  connexion with that branch of the inquiry. Etheric atoms combine to form
  molecules in many different ways, but combinations involving fewer atoms
  than the eighteen which give rise to hydrogen, make no impression on the
  physical senses nor on physical instruments of research. They give rise
  to varieties of molecular ether, the comprehension of which begins to
  illuminate realms of natural mystery as yet entirely untrodden by the
  ordinary physicist. Combinations below 18 in number give rise to three
  varieties of molecular ether, the functions of which when they come to be
  more fully studied will constitute a department of natural knowledge on
  the threshold of which we already stand. Some day we may perhaps be
  presented with a volume on Occult Physics as important in its way as the
  present dissertation on Occult Chemistry.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER II.</h3>

<h3>DETAILS OF THE EARLY RESEARCH.</h3>

  <p>The article detailing the results of the research carried on in the
  year 1895 (see the November issue for that year of the magazine then
  called <i>Lucifer</i>), began with some general remarks about the
  clairvoyant faculty, already discussed in the preceding chapter. The
  original record then goes on as follows:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The physical world is regarded as being composed of between sixty and
  seventy chemical elements, aggregated into an infinite variety of
  combinations. These combinations fall under the three main heads of
  solids, liquids and gases, the recognised substates of physical matter,
  with the theoretical ether scarcely admitted as material. Ether, to the
  scientist, is not a substate or even a state of matter, but is a
  something apart by itself. It would not be allowed that gold could be
  raised to the etheric condition as it might be to the liquid and gaseous;
  whereas the occultist knows that the gaseous is succeeded by the etheric,
  as the solid is succeeded by the liquid, and he knows also that the word
  "ether" covers four substates as distinct from each other as are the
  solids, liquids and gases, and that all chemical elements have their four
  etheric substates, the highest being common to all, and consisting of the
  ultimate physical atoms to which all elements are finally reducible. The
  chemical atom is regarded as the ultimate particle of any element, and is
  supposed to be indivisible and unable to exist in a free state. Mr.
  Crookes' researches have led the more advanced chemists to regard the
  atoms as compound, as a more or less complex aggregation of protyle.</p>

  <p>To astral vision ether is a visible thing, and is seen permeating all
  substances and encircling every particle. A "solid" body is a body
  composed of a vast number of particles suspended in ether, each vibrating
  backwards and forwards in a particular field at a high rate of velocity;
  the particles are attracted towards each other more strongly than they
  are attracted by external influences, and they "cohere," or maintain
  towards each other a definite relation in space. Closer examination shows
  that the ether is not homogeneous but consists of particles of numerous
  kinds, differing in the aggregations of the minute bodies composing them;
  and a careful and more detailed method of analysis reveals that it has
  four distinct degrees, giving us, with the solid, liquid and gaseous,
  seven instead of four substates of matter in the physical world.</p>

  <p>These four etheric substates will be best understood if the method be
  explained by which they were studied. This method consisted of taking
  what is called an atom of gas, and breaking it up time after time, until
  what proved to be the ultimate physical atom was reached, the breaking up
  of this last resulting in the production of astral, and no longer
  physical matter.</p>

  </div>
  <p>It is, of course, impossible to convey by words the clear conceptions
  that are gained by direct vision of the objects of study, and the
  accompanying diagram&mdash;cleverly drawn from the description given by
  the investigators&mdash;is offered as a substitute, however poor, for the
  lacking vision of the readers. The horizontal lines separate from each
  other the seven substates of matter; solid, liquid, gas, ether 4, ether
  3, ether 2, ether 1. On the gas level are represented three chemical
  atoms, one of hydrogen (H), one of oxygen (O), one of nitrogen (N). The
  successive changes undergone by each chemical atom are shown in the
  compartments vertically above it, the left-hand column showing the
  breaking up of the hydrogen atom, the middle column that of the oxygen
  atom, the right-hand column, that of the nitrogen atom. The ultimate
  physical atom is marked <i>a</i>, and is drawn only once, although it is
  the same throughout. The numbers 18, 290 and 261 are the numbers of the
  ultimate physical atoms found to exist in a chemical atom.</p>

  <p>The dots indicate the lines along which force is observed to be
  playing, and the arrowheads show the direction of the force. No attempt
  has been made to show this below E&nbsp;2 except in the case of the hydrogen.
  The letters given are intended to help the reader to trace upwards any
  special body; thus <i>d</i> in the oxygen chemical atom on the gas level
  may be found again on E&nbsp;4, E&nbsp;3, and E&nbsp;2. It must be remembered that the
  bodies shown diagrammatically in no way indicate relative size; as a body
  is raised from one substate to the one immediately above it, it is
  enormously magnified for the purpose of investigation, and the ultimate
  atom on E&nbsp;1 is represented by the dot <i>a</i> on the gaseous level.</p>

  <p>The first chemical atom selected for this examination was an atom of
  hydrogen (H). On looking carefully at it, it was seen to consist of six
  small bodies, contained in an egg-like form. It rotated with great
  rapidity on its own axis, vibrating at the same time, and the internal
  bodies performed similar gyrations. The whole atom spins and quivers, and
  has to be steadied before exact observation is possible. The six little
  bodies are arranged in two sets of three, forming two triangles that are
  not interchangeable, but are related to each other as object and image.
  (The lines in the diagram of it on the gaseous sub-plane are not lines of
  force, but show the two triangles; on a plane surface the
  interpenetration of the triangles cannot be clearly indicated.) Further,
  the six bodies are not all alike; they each contain three smaller
  bodies&mdash;each of these being an ultimate physical atom&mdash;but in
  two of them the three atoms are arranged in a line, while in the
  remaining four they are arranged in a triangle.</p>

  <p>The wall of the limiting spheroid in which the bodies are enclosed
  being composed of the matter of the third, or gaseous, kind, drops away
  when the gaseous atom is raised to the next level, and the six bodies are
  set free. They at once re-arrange themselves in two triangles, each
  enclosed by a limiting sphere; the two marked <i>b</i> in the diagram
  unite with one of those marked <i>b'</i> to form a body which shows a
  positive character, the remaining three forming a second body negative in
  type. These form the hydrogen particles of the lowest plane of ether,
  marked E&nbsp;4&mdash;ether 4&mdash;on the diagram. On raising these further,
  they undergo another disintegration, losing their limiting walls; the
  positive body of E&nbsp;4, on losing its wall, becomes two bodies, one
  consisting of the two particles, marked <i>b</i>, distinguishable by the
  linear arrangement of the contained ultimate atoms, enclosed in a wall,
  and the other being the third body enclosed in E&nbsp;4 and now set free. The
  negative body of E&nbsp;4 similarly, on losing its wall, becomes two bodies,
  one consisting of the two particles marked <i>b'</i>, and the second the
  remaining body, being set free. These free bodies do not remain on E&nbsp;3
  but pass immediately to E&nbsp;2, leaving the positive and negative bodies,
  each containing two particles, as the representatives of hydrogen on E&nbsp;3.
  On taking these bodies a step higher their wall disappears, and the
  internal bodies are set free, those containing the atoms arranged
  lineally being positive, and those with the triangular arrangement being
  negative. These two forms represent hydrogen on E&nbsp;2, but similar bodies
  of this state of matter are found entering into other combinations, as
  may be seen by referring to <i>f</i> on E&nbsp;2 of nitrogen (N). On raising
  these bodies yet one step further, the falling away of the walls sets the
  contained atoms free, and we reach the ultimate physical atom, the matter
  of E&nbsp;1. The disintegration of this sets free particles of astral matter,
  so that we have reached in this the limit of physical matter. The
  Theosophical reader will notice with interest that we can thus observe
  seven distinct substates of physical matter, and no more.</p>

  <p>The ultimate atom, which is the same in all the observed cases, is an
  exceedingly complex body, and only its main characteristics are given in
  the diagram. It is composed entirely of spirals, the spiral being in its
  turn composed of spirillæ, and these again of minuter spirillæ. A fairly
  accurate drawing is given in Babbitt's "Principles of Light and Colour,"
  p. 102. The illustrations there given of atomic combinations are entirely
  wrong and misleading, but if the stove-pipe run through the centre of the
  single atom be removed, the picture may be taken as correct, and will
  give some idea of the complexity of this fundamental unit of the physical
  universe.</p>

  <p>Turning to the force side of the atom and its combinations, we observe
  that force pours in the heart-shaped depression at the top of the atom,
  and issues from the point, and is changed in character by its passage;
  further, force rushes through every spiral and every spirilla, and the
  changing shades of colour that flash out from the rapidly revolving and
  vibrating atom depend on the several activities of the spirals; sometimes
  one, sometimes another, is thrown into more energetic action, and with
  the change of activity from one spiral to another the colour changes.</p>

  <p>The building of a gaseous atom of hydrogen may be traced downward from
  E&nbsp;1, and, as stated above, the lines given in the diagram are intended to
  indicate the play of the forces which bring about the several
  combinations. Speaking generally, positive bodies are marked by their
  contained atoms setting their points towards each other and the centre of
  their combination, and repelling each other outwards; negative bodies are
  marked by the heart-shaped depressions being turned inwards, and by a
  tendency to move towards each other instead of away. Every combination
  begins by a welling up of force at a centre, which is to form the centre
  of the combination; in the first positive hydrogen combination, E&nbsp;2, an
  atom revolving at right angles to the plane of the paper and also
  revolving on its own axis, forms the centre, and force, rushing out at
  its lower point, rushes in at the depressions of two other atoms, which
  then set themselves with their points to the centre; the lines are shown
  in +b, right-hand figure. (The left-hand figure indicates the revolution
  of the atoms each by itself.) As this atomic triad whirls round, it
  clears itself a space, pressing back the undifferentiated matter of the
  plane, and making to itself a whirling wall of this matter, thus taking
  the first step towards building up the chemical hydrogen atom. A negative
  atomic triad is similarly formed, the three atoms being symmetrically
  arranged round the centre of out-welling force. These atomic triads then
  combine, two of the linear arrangement being attracted to each other, and
  two of the triangular, force again welling up and forming a centre and
  acting on the triads as on a single atom, and a limiting wall being again
  formed as the combination revolves round its centre. The next stage is
  produced by each of these combinations on E&nbsp;3 attracting to itself a
  third atomic triad of the triangular type from E&nbsp;2, by the setting up of
  a new centre of up-welling force, following the lines traced in the
  combinations of E&nbsp;4. Two of these uniting, and their triangles
  interpenetrating, the chemical atom is formed, and we find it to contain
  in all eighteen ultimate physical atoms.</p>

  <p>The next substance investigated was oxygen, a far more complicated and
  puzzling body; the difficulties of observation were very much increased
  by the extraordinary activity shown by this element and the dazzling
  brilliancy of some of its constituents. The gaseous atom is an ovoid
  body, within which a spirally-coiled snake-like body revolves at a high
  velocity, five brilliant points of light shining on the coils. The snake
  appears to be a solid rounded body, but on raising the atom to E&nbsp;4 the
  snake splits lengthwise into two waved bodies, and it is seen that the
  appearance of solidity is due to the fact that these spin round a common
  axis in opposite directions, and so present a continuous surface, as a
  ring of fire can be made by whirling a lighted stick. The brilliant
  bodies seen in the atom are on the crests of the waves in the positive
  snake, and in the hollows in the negative one; the snake itself consists
  of small bead-like bodies, eleven of which interpose between the larger
  brilliant spots. On raising these bodies to E&nbsp;3 the snakes break up, each
  bright spot carrying with it six beads on one side and five on the other;
  these twist and writhe about still with the same extraordinary activity,
  reminding one of fire-flies stimulated to wild gyrations. It can been
  seen that the larger brilliant bodies each enclose seven ultimate atoms,
  while the beads each enclose two. (Each bright spot with its eleven beads
  is enclosed in a wall, accidentally omitted in the diagram.) On the next
  stage, E&nbsp;2, the fragments of the snakes break up into their constituent
  parts; the positive and negative bodies, marked <i>d</i> and <i>d'</i>,
  showing a difference of arrangement of the atoms contained in them. These
  again finally disintegrate, setting free the ultimate physical atoms,
  identical with those obtained from hydrogen. The number of ultimate atoms
  contained in the gaseous atom of oxygen is 290, made up as
  follows:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>2 in each bead, of which there are 110:</p>
      <p>7 in each bright spot, of which there are 10;</p>
      <p>2 x 110 + 70 = 290.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>When the observers had worked out this, they compared it with the
  number of ultimate atoms in hydrogen:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>290 / 18 = 16.11 +</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The respective number of ultimate atoms contained in a chemical atom
  of these two bodies are thus seen to closely correspond with their
  accepted weight-numbers.</p>

  <p>It may be said in passing that a chemical atom of ozone appears as an
  oblate spheroid, with the contained spiral much compressed and widened in
  the centre; the spiral consists of three snakes, one positive and two
  negative, formed in a single revolving body. On raising the chemical atom
  to the next plane, the snake divides into three, each being enclosed in
  its own egg.</p>

  <p>The chemical atom of nitrogen was the third selected by the students
  for examination, as it seemed comparatively quiet in contrast with the
  ever-excited oxygen. It proved, however, to be the most complicated of
  all in its internal arrangements, and its quiet was therefore a little
  deceptive. Most prominent was the balloon-shaped body in the middle, with
  six smaller bodies in two horizontal rows and one large egg-shaped one in
  the midst, contained in it. Some chemical atoms were seen in which the
  internal arrangement of these contained bodies was changed and the two
  horizontal rows became vertical; this change seemed to be connected with
  a greater activity of the whole body, but the observations on this head
  are too incomplete to be reliable. The balloon-shaped body is positive,
  and is apparently drawn downwards towards the negative egg-shaped body
  below it, containing seven smaller particles. In addition to these large
  bodies, four small ones are seen, two positive and two negative, the
  positive containing five and the negative four minuter spots. On raising
  the gaseous atom to E&nbsp;4, the falling away of the wall sets free the six
  contained bodies, and both the balloon and the egg round themselves,
  apparently with the removal of their propinquity, as though they had
  exercised over each other some attractive influence. The smaller bodies
  within the egg&mdash;marked <i>q</i> on E&nbsp;4&mdash;are not on one plane,
  and those within <i>n</i> and <i>o</i> form respectively square-based and
  triangular-based pyramids. On raising all these bodies to E&nbsp;3 we find the
  walls fall away as usual, and the contents of each "cell" are set free:
  <i>p</i> of E&nbsp;4 contains six small bodies marked <i>k</i>, and these are
  shown in <i>k</i> of E&nbsp;3, as containing each seven little
  bodies&mdash;marked <i>e</i>&mdash;each of which has within it two
  ultimate atoms; the long form of <i>p</i> E&nbsp;4&mdash;marked
  <i>l</i>&mdash;appears as the long form <i>l</i> on E&nbsp;3, and this has
  three pairs of smaller bodies within it, <i>f'</i>, <i>g</i> and
  <i>h</i>, containing respectively three, four and six ultimate atoms;
  <i>q</i> of E&nbsp;4, with its seven contained particles, <i>m</i>, has three
  particles <i>m</i> on E&nbsp;3, each showing three ultimate atoms within them;
  <i>e</i> from <i>n</i> of E&nbsp;4 becomes <i>i</i> of E&nbsp;3, with contained
  bodies, <i>e</i>, showing two ultimate atoms in each; while <i>e'</i>
  from <i>o</i> of E&nbsp;4 becomes <i>j</i> of E&nbsp;3, each having three smaller
  bodies within it, <i>e'</i>, with two ultimate atoms in each. On E&nbsp;2, the
  arrangement of these ultimate atoms is shown, and the pairs, <i>f'</i>,
  <i>g</i> and <i>h</i> are seen with the lines of force indicated; the
  triads in <i>f</i>&mdash;from <i>m</i> of E&nbsp;3&mdash;are similarly shown,
  and the duads in <i>e</i> and <i>e'</i>&mdash;from <i>i</i> and <i>j</i>
  of E&nbsp;3&mdash;are given in the same way. When all these bodies are raised
  to E&nbsp;1, the ultimate physical atoms are set free, identical, of course,
  with that previously described. Reckoning up the number of ultimate
  physical atoms in a chemical atom of nitrogen we find they amount to 261,
  thus divided:&mdash;</p>

<pre>
        62 +  bodies with 2 ultimate atoms, 62 x 2 = 124
        24 -    "     "   2    "       "    24 x 2 =  48
        21 -    "     "   3    "       "    21 x 3 =  63
         2 +    "     "   3    "       "     2 x 3 =   6
         2 +    "     "   4    "       "     2 x 4 =   8
         2 +    "     "   4    "       "     2 x 6 =  12
                                                    ----
                                                     261
</pre>
  <p>This again approaches closely the weight-number assigned to
  nitrogen:&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>261 / 18 =14.44 +</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is interesting as checking the observations, for weight-numbers
  are arrived at in so very different a fashion, and especially in the case
  of nitrogen the approximation is noteworthy, from the complexity of the
  bodies which yield the number on analysis.</p>

  <p>Some other observations were made which went to show that as
  weight-numbers increased, there was a corresponding increase in the
  number of bodies discerned within the chemical atom; thus, gold showed
  forty-seven contained bodies; but these observations need repetition and
  checking. Investigation of a molecule of water revealed the presence of
  twelve bodies from hydrogen and the characteristic snake of oxygen, the
  encircling walls of the chemical atoms being broken away. But here again,
  further observations are necessary to substantiate details. The present
  paper is only offered as a suggestion of an inviting line of research,
  promising interesting results of a scientific character; the observations
  recorded have been repeated several times and are not the work of a
  single investigator, and they are believed to be correct so far as they
  go.</p>

<h3>THE PLATONIC SOLIDS.</h3>

  <p>Some of our readers may be glad to have a drawing of the Platonic
  solids, since they play so large a part in the building up of elements.
  The regular solids are five, and five only; in each:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p>(1) The lines are equal.</p>
      <p>(2) The angles are equal.</p>
      <p>(3) The surfaces are equal.</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-002.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-002.png"
      alt="The five Platonic solids." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>It will be seen that the tetrahedron is the fundamental form, the
  three-sided pyramid on a triangular base, <i>i.e.</i>, a solid figure
  formed from four triangles. Two of these generate the cube and the
  octahedron; five of these generate the dodecahedron and the
  icosahedron.</p>

  <p>The rhombic dodecahedron is not regular, for though the lines and
  surfaces are equal, the angles are not.</p>

<h3>NOTES.</h3>

  <p>Mr. C. Jinarâjadâsa<a name="NtA_1" href="#Nt_1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>
  writes:</p>

  <p>The asterisk put before metargon in the list of elements should be
  omitted, for metargon had been discovered by Sir William Ramsey and Mr.
  Travers at the same time as neon (see <i>Proceedings of the Royal
  Society</i>, vol. lxiii, p. 411), and therefore before it was observed
  clairvoyantly. It is not, however, given in the latest list of elements
  in the Report of November 13, 1907, of the International Atomic Weights
  Commission, so it would seem as though it were not yet fully
  recognised.</p>

  <p>Neon was discovered in 1898 by Ramsey and Travers, and the weight
  given to it was 22. This almost corresponds with our weight for
  meta-neon, 22.33; the latest weight given to neon is 20, and that
  corresponds within one-tenth to our weight, 19.9. From this it would seem
  that neon was examined in the later investigations and meta-neon in the
  earlier.</p>

  <p>He says further on a probable <i>fourth</i> Interperiodic Group:</p>

  <p>Thinking over the diagrams, it seemed to me likely that a fourth group
  exists, coming on the paramagnetic side, directly under iron, cobalt,
  nickel, just one complete swing of the pendulum after rhodium, ruthenium,
  palladium. This would make four interperiodic groups, and they would come
  also <i>periodically</i> in the table too.</p>

  <p>I took the diagram for Osmium, and in a bar postulated only three
  columns for the first element of the new groups, <i>i.e.</i>, one column
  less than in Osmium. This would make 183 atoms in a bar; the new group
  then would follow in a bar, 183, 185, 187. Here I found to my surprise
  that the third postulated group would have a remarkable relation to Os,
  Ir, Pt.</p>

  <p>Thus</p>

<pre>
        Os.--245     (in a bar);      less 60 = 185
        Ir.  247                      less 60 = 187
        Pt.  249                      less 60 = 189
</pre>
  <p>But strange to say <i>also</i></p>

<pre>
    Ruthenium (bar) 132              less 60--72
    Rhodium         134              less 60--74
    Palladium       136              less 60--76
</pre>
  <p>But 72, 74, 76, are Iron, Cobalt and Nickel.</p>

  <p>So there does probably exist a new group with bars (183), 185, 187,
  189, with atomic weights.</p>

<pre>
    X=bar 185;      atoms      2590, wt. 143.3
    Y=    187,                 2618, wt. 145.4
    Z=    189,                 2646, wt. 147.0.
</pre>
  <p>They come probably among the rare earths. Probably also Neodymium and
  Praseodymium are two of them, for their weights are 143.6, 140.5.</p>

<h3>CHAPTER III.</h3>

<h3>THE LATER RESEARCHES.</h3>

  <p>The first difficulty that faced us was the identification of the forms
  seen on focusing the sight on gases.<a name="NtA_2"
  href="#Nt_2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> We could only proceed tentatively. Thus,
  a very common form in the air had a sort of dumb-bell shape (see <a
  href="#PlateI">Plate I</a>); we examined this, comparing our rough
  sketches, and counted its atoms; these, divided by 18&mdash;the number of
  ultimate atoms in hydrogen&mdash;gave us 23.22 as atomic weight, and this
  offered the presumption that it was sodium. We then took various
  substances&mdash;common salt, etc.&mdash;in which we knew sodium was
  present, and found the dumb-bell form in all. In other cases, we took
  small fragments of metals, as iron, tin, zinc, silver, gold; in others,
  again, pieces of ore, mineral waters, etc., etc., and, for the rarest
  substances, Mr. Leadbeater visited a mineralogical museum. In all, 57
  chemical elements were examined, out of the 78 recognized by modern
  chemistry.</p>

  <p>In addition to these, we found 3 chemical waifs: an unrecognized
  stranger between hydrogen and helium which we named occultum, for
  purposes of reference, and 2 varieties of one element, which we named
  kalon and meta-kalon, between xenon and osmium; we also found 4 varieties
  of 4 recognized elements and prefixed meta to the name of each, and a
  second form of platinum, that we named Pt. B. Thus we have tabulated in
  all 65 chemical elements, or chemical atoms, completing three of Sir
  William Crookes' lemniscates, sufficient for some amount of
  generalization.</p>

  <p><a name="PlateI"></a></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-003.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-003.png"
      alt="Plate I. Sodium." /></a>
    <font class="sc">Plate I. Sodium</font>.
  </div>
  <p>In counting the number of ultimate atoms in a chemical elemental atom,
  we did not count them throughout, one by one; when, for instance, we
  counted up the ultimate atoms in sodium, we dictated the number in each
  convenient group to Mr. Jinarâjadâsa, and he multiplied out the total,
  divided by 18, and announced the result. Thus: sodium (<i>see</i> Plate
  I) is composed of an upper part, divisible into a globe and 12 funnels; a
  lower part, similarly divided; and a connecting rod. We counted the
  number in the upper part: globe&mdash;10; the number in two or three of
  the funnels&mdash;each 16; the number of funnels&mdash;12; the same for
  the lower part; in the connecting rod&mdash;14. Mr. Jinarâjadâsa
  reckoned: 10 + (16 x 12) = 202; hence: 202 + 202 + 14 = 418: divided by
  18 = 23.22 recurring. By this method we guarded our counting from any
  prepossession, as it was impossible for us to know how the various
  numbers would result on addition, multiplication and division, and the
  exciting moment came when we waited to see if our results endorsed or
  approached any accepted weight. In the heavier elements, such as gold,
  with 3546 atoms, it would have been impossible to count each atom without
  quite unnecessary waste of time, when making a preliminary investigation.
  Later, it may be worth while to count each division separately, as in
  some we noticed that two groups, at first sight alike, differed by 1 or 2
  atoms, and some very slight errors may, in this way, have crept into our
  calculations.</p>

  <p>In the following table is a list of the chemical elements examined;
  the first column gives the names, the asterisk affixed to some indicating
  that they have not yet been discovered by orthodox chemistry. The second
  column gives the number of ultimate physical atoms contained in one
  chemical atom of the element concerned. The third column gives the weight
  as compared with hydrogen, taken as 18, and this is obtained by dividing
  the calculated number of ultimate atoms by 18. The fourth column gives
  the recognized weight-number, mostly according to the latest list of
  atomic weights, the "International List" of 1905, given in Erdmann's
  "Lehrbuch der Unorganischen Chemie." These weights differ from those
  hitherto accepted, and are generally lighter than those given in earlier
  text-books. It is interesting to note that our counting endorses the
  earlier numbers, for the most part, and we must wait to see if later
  observations will endorse the last results of orthodox chemistry, or
  confirm ours.</p>

      alt="Plate II - Ultimate physical atoms." /></a>
    PLATE II. MALE (left) and FEMALE (right).
  </div>
  <p>As the words "ultimate physical atom" must frequently occur, it is
  necessary to state what we mean by the phrase. Any gaseous chemical atom
  may be dissociated into less complicated bodies; these, again, into still
  less complicated; these, again, into yet still less complicated. These
  will be dealt with presently. After the third dissociation but one more
  is possible; the fourth dissociation gives the ultimate physical atom.<a
  name="NtA_3" href="#Nt_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> This may vanish from the
  physical plane, but it can undergo no further dissociation on it. In this
  ultimate state of physical matter two types of atoms have been observed;
  they are alike in everything save the direction of their whorls and of
  the force which pours through them. In the one case force pours in from
  the "outside," from fourth-dimensional space,<a name="NtA_4"
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and passing through the atom, pours into
  the physical world. In the second, it pours in from the physical world,
  and out through the atom into the "outside" again,<a
  href="#Nt_4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> <i>i.e.</i>, vanishes from the physical
  world. The one is like a spring, from which water bubbles out; the other
  is like a hole, into which water disappears. We call the atoms from which
  force comes out <i>positive</i> or <i>male</i>; those through which it
  disappears, <i>negative</i> or <i>female</i>. All atoms, so far as
  observed, are of one or other of these two forms. (Plate II.)</p>

  <p>It will be seen that the atom is a sphere, slightly flattened, and
  there is a depression at the point where the force flows in, causing a
  heart-like form. Each atom is surrounded by a field, formed of the atoms
  of the four higher planes, which surround and interpenetrate it.</p>

  <p>The atom can scarcely be said to be a "thing," though it is the
  material out of which all things physical are composed. It is formed by
  the flow of the life-force<a name="NtA_5" href="#Nt_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a>
  and vanishes with its ebb. When this force arises in "space"<a
  name="NtA_6" href="#Nt_6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>&mdash;the apparent void
  which must be filled with substance of some kind, of inconceivable
  tenuity&mdash;atoms appear; if this be artificially stopped for a single
  atom, the atom disappears; there is nothing left. Presumably, were that
  flow checked but for an instant, the whole physical world would vanish,
  as a cloud melts away in the empyrean. It is only the persistence of that
  flow<a name="NtA_7" href="#Nt_7"><sup>[7]</sup></a> which maintains the
  physical basis of the universe.<a name="NtA_8"
  href="#Nt_8"><sup>[8]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In order to examine the construction of the atom, a space is
  artificially made<a name="NtA_9" href="#Nt_9"><sup>[9]</sup></a>; then,
  if an opening be made in the wall thus constructed, the surrounding force
  flows in, and three whorls immediately appear, surrounding the "hole"
  with their triple spiral of two and a half coils, and returning to their
  origin by a spiral within the atom; these are at once followed by seven
  finer whorls, which following the spiral of the first three on the outer
  surface, and returning to their origin by a spiral within that, flowing
  in the opposite direction&mdash;form a caduceus with the first three.
  Each of the three coarser whorls, flattened out, makes a closed circle;
  each of the seven finer ones, similarly flattened out, makes a closed
  circle. The forces which flow in them, again, come from "outside," from a
  fourth-dimensional space.<a name="NtA_10"
  href="#Nt_10"><sup>[10]</sup></a> Each of the finer whorls is formed of
  seven yet finer ones, set successively at right angles to each other,
  each finer than its predecessor; these we call spirillæ.<a name="NtA_11"
  href="#Nt_11"><sup>[11]</sup></a></p>

  <p>It will be understood from the foregoing, that the atom cannot be said
  to have a wall of its own, unless these whorls of force can be so
  designated; its "wall" is the pressed back "space." As said in 1895, of
  the chemical atom, the force "clears itself a space, pressing back the
  undifferentiated matter of the plane, and making to itself a whirling
  wall of this matter." The wall belongs to space, not to the atom.</p>

  <p>In the three whorls flow currents of different electricities; the
  seven vibrate in response to etheric waves of all kinds&mdash;to sound,
  light, heat, etc.; they show the seven colours of the spectrum; give out
  the seven sounds of the natural scale; respond in a variety of ways to
  physical vibration&mdash;flashing, singing, pulsing bodies, they move
  incessantly, inconceivably beautiful and brilliant.<a name="NtA_12"
  href="#Nt_12"><sup>[12]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The atom has&mdash;as observed so far&mdash;three proper motions,
  <i>i.e.</i>, motions of its own, independent of any imposed upon it from
  outside. It turns incessantly upon its own axis, spinning like a top; it
  describes a small circle with its axis, as though the axis of the
  spinning top moved in a small circle; it has a regular pulsation, a
  contraction and expansion, like the pulsation of the heart. When a force
  is brought to bear upon it, it dances up and down, flings itself wildly
  from side to side, performs the most astonishing and rapid gyrations, but
  the three fundamental motions incessantly persist. If it be made to
  vibrate, as a whole, at the rate which gives any one of the seven colors,
  the whorl belonging to that color glows out brilliantly.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-005.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-005.png"
      alt="Arrangement of atoms in an electric current." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>An electric current brought to bear upon the atoms checks their proper
  motions, <i>i.e.</i>, renders them slower; the atoms exposed to it
  arrange themselves in parallel lines, and in each line the heart-shaped
  depression receives the flow, which passes out through the apex into the
  depression of the next, and so on. The atoms always set themselves to the
  current. The well-known division of diamagnetic and paramagnetic depends
  generally on this fact, or on an analogous action on molecules, as may be
  seen in the accompanying diagrams.<a name="NtA_13"
  href="#Nt_13"><sup>[13]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Two atoms, positive and negative, brought near to each other, attract
  each other, and then commence to revolve round each other, forming a
  relatively stable duality; such a molecule is neutral. Combinations of
  three or more atoms are positive, negative or neutral, according to the
  internal molecular arrangement; the neutral are relatively stable, the
  positive and negative are continually in search of their respective
  opposites, with a view to establishing a relatively permanent union.</p>

  <p>Three states of matter exist between the atomic state and the
  gaseous&mdash;the state in which the chemical atoms are found, the
  recognized chemical elements; for our purposes we may ignore the liquid
  and solid states. For the sake of clearness and brevity in description,
  we have been obliged to name these states; we call the atomic state of
  the chemist <i>elemental</i>; the state which results from breaking up
  chemical elements, <i>proto-elemental</i>; the next higher,
  <i>meta-proto-elemental</i>; the next higher,
  <i>hyper-meta-proto-elemental</i>; then comes the atomic state. These are
  briefly marked as El., Proto., Meta., and Hyper.<a name="NtA_14"
  href="#Nt_14"><sup>[14]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The simplest unions of atoms, never, apparently consisting of more
  than seven, form the first molecular state of physical matter.</p>

  <p><a name="Hyper"></a></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-006.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-006.png"
      alt="Types of Hyper-Meta-Proto-Elemental Matter." /></a>
    <font class="sc">Types of Hyper-Meta-Proto-Elemental Matter</font>.
  </div>
  <p>Here are some characteristic combinations of the Hyper state; the atom
  is conventional, with the depression emphasised; the lines, always
  entering at the depression and coming out at the apex, show the
  resultants of lines of force; where no line appears entering the
  depression, the force wells up from fourth-dimensional space; where no
  line appears leaving the apex, the force disappears into
  fourth-dimensional space; where the point of entry and departure is
  outside the atoms, it is indicated by a dot.<a name="NtA_15"
  href="#Nt_15"><sup>[15]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The molecules show all kinds of possible combinations; the
  combinations spin, turn head over heels, and gyrate in endless ways. Each
  aggregation is surrounded with an apparent cell-wall, the circle or oval,
  due to the pressure on the surrounding matter caused by its whirling
  motion; they strike on each other<a name="NtA_16"
  href="#Nt_16"><sup>[16]</sup></a> and rebound, dart hither and thither,
  for reasons we have not distinguished.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-007.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-007.png"
      alt="Types of Meta-Proto-Elemental Matter" /></a>
    <font class="sc">Types of Meta-Proto-Elemental Matter</font>.
  </div>
  <p>The Meta state, in some of its combinations, appears at first sight to
  repeat those of the Hyper state; the only obvious way of distinguishing
  to which some of the molecules of less complexity belong is to pull them
  out of the "cell-wall"; if they are Hyper molecules they at once fly off
  as separate atoms; if they are Meta molecules they break up into two or
  more molecules containing a smaller number of atoms. Thus one of the Meta
  molecules of iron, containing seven atoms, is identical in appearance
  with a Hyper heptad, but the latter dissociates into seven atoms, the
  former into two triads and a single atom. Long-continued research into
  the detailed play of forces and their results is necessary; we are here
  only able to give preliminary facts and details&mdash;are opening up the
  way. The following may serve as characteristic Meta types:&mdash;</p>

  <p>These are taken from constituents of the various elements; 1 from Gl;
  2 and 3 from Fe; 4 from Bo; 5, 6 and 7 from C; 8 from He; 9 from Fl; 10,
  11, 12 from Li; 13 and 14 from Na. Others will be seen in the course of
  breaking up the elements.</p>

  <p>The Proto state preserves many of the forms in the elements, modified
  by release from the pressure to which they are subjected in the chemical
  atom. In this state various groups are thus recognizable which are
  characteristic of allied metals.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-008.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-008.png"
      alt="Types of Proto-Elemental Matter" /></a>
    <font class="sc">Types of Proto-Elemental Matter</font>.
  </div>
  <p>These are taken from the products of the first disintegration of the
  chemical atom, by forcibly removing it from its hole. The groups fly
  apart, assuming a great variety of forms often more or less geometrical;
  the lines between the constituents of the groups, where indicated, no
  longer represent lines of force, but are intended to represent the
  impression of form, <i>i.e.</i>, of the relative position and motion of
  the constituents, made on the mind of the observer. They are elusive, for
  there are no lines, but the appearance of lines is caused by the rapid
  motion of the costituents up and down, or along them backwards and
  forwards. The dots represent atoms, or groups of atoms, within the
  proto-elements. 1 is found in C; 2 and 3 in He; 4 in Fl; 5 in Li; 6 in N;
  7 in Ru; 8 in Na; 9 and 10 in Co; 11 in Fe; 12 in Se. We shall return to
  these when analysing the elements, and shall meet many other
  proto-elemental groupings.</p>

  <p>The first thing which is noticed by the observer, when he turns his
  attention to the chemical atoms, is that they show certain definite
  forms, and that within these forms, modified in various ways,
  sub-groupings are observable which recur in connexion with the same
  modified form. The main types are not very numerous, and we found that,
  when we arranged the atoms we had observed, according to their external
  forms, they fell into natural classes; when these, in turn, were compared
  with Sir William Crookes' classification, they proved to be singularly
  alike. Here is his arrangement of the elements, as it appeared in the
  <i>Proceedings of the Royal Society</i>, in a paper read on June 9th,
  1898.</p>

  <p><a name="Crookes"></a></p>

  <div class="figcenter" style="width:50%;">

      alt="Sir William Crookes' classification." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>This is to be read, following the lines of the "figures of eight": H,
  He, Li, Gl, B, C, N, and so on, each successive element being heavier
  than the one preceding it in order. The disks which fall immediately
  below each other form a class; thus: H, Cl, Br, I; these resemble each
  other in various ways, and, as we shall presently see, the same forms and
  groupings re-appear.</p>

  <p>Another chart&mdash;taken from Erdmann's
  <i>Lehrbuch</i>&mdash;arranges the elements on a curved line, which
  curiously resembles the curves within the shell of a nautilus. The
  radiating lines show the classes, the whole diameter building up a
  family; it will be observed that there is an empty radius between
  hydrogen and helium, and we have placed occultum there; on the opposite
  radius, iron, rubidium and osmium are seen.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The external forms may be classified as follows; the internal details
  will be dealt with later :&mdash;</p>

  <p><a name="PlateIII"></a></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-011.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-011.png"
      alt="Plate III." /></a>
    <font class="sc">Plate III</font>.
  </div>
  <p>1. <i>The Dumb-bell.</i>&mdash;The characteristics of this are a
  higher and lower group, each showing 12 projecting funnels, grouped round
  a central body, and a connecting rod. It appears in sodium, copper,
  silver, and gold,<a name="NtA_17" href="#Nt_17"><sup>[17]</sup></a> and
  gold is given (1 on <a href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>) as the most
  extremely modified example of this form. The 12 almond-like projections,
  above and below, are severally contained in shadowy funnels, impossible
  to reproduce in the drawing; the central globe contains three globes, and
  the connecting portion has swollen out into an egg, with a very
  complicated central arrangement. The dumb-bell appears also in chlorine,
  bromine and iodine, but there is no trace of it in hydrogen, the head of
  the group. We have not met it elsewhere. It may be remarked that, in Sir
  William Crookes' scheme, in which they are all classed as monads, these
  two groups are the nearest to the neutral line, on the ingoing and
  outgoing series, and are respectively positive and negative.</p>

  <p>II and II<i>a.</i> <i>The Tetrahedron.</i>&mdash;The characteristics
  of this form are four funnels, containing ovoid bodies, opening on the
  face of a tetrahedron. The funnels generally, but not always, radiate
  from a central globe. We give beryllium (glucinum) as the simplest
  example (2 on <a href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>), and to this group
  belong calcium and strontium. The tetrahedron is the form of chromium and
  molybdenum, but not that of the head of their group, oxygen, which is,
  like hydrogen, <i>sui generis</i>. These two groups are marked in
  orthodox chemistry as respectively positive and negative, and are closely
  allied. Another pair of groups show the same tetrahedral form: magnesium,
  zinc and cadmium, positive; sulphur, selenium and tellurium, negative.
  Selenium is a peculiarly beautiful element, with a star floating across
  the mouth of each funnel; this star is extremely sensitive to light, and
  its rays tremble violently and bend if a beam of light falls on it. All
  these are dyads.</p>

  <p>The tetrahedron is not confined to the external form of the above
  atoms; it seems to be one of the favourite forms of nature, and
  repeatedly appears in the internal arrangements. There is one tetrahedron
  within the unknown element occultum; two appear in helium (3 on <a
  href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>); yttrium has also two within its cube, as
  has germanium; five, intersecting, are found in neon, meta-neon, argon,
  metargon, krypton, meta-krypton, xenon, meta-xenon, kalon, meta-kalon,
  tin, titanium and zirconium. Gold contains no less than twenty
  tetrahedra.</p>

  <p>III. <i>The Cube.</i>&mdash;The cube appears to be the form of triads.
  It has six funnels, containing ovoids, and opening on the faces of the
  cube. Boron is chosen as an example (4 on <a href="#PlateIII">Plate
  III</a>). Its group members, scandium and yttrium, have the same form; we
  have not examined the fourth; the group is positive. Its negative
  complement consists of nitrogen, vanadium and niobium, and we have again
  to note that nitrogen, like hydrogen and oxygen, departs from its group
  type. Two other triad groups, the positive aluminium, gallium and indium
  (the fourth unexamined) and the negative phosphorus, arsenic and antimony
  (the fourth unexamined), have also six funnels opening on the faces of a
  cube.</p>

  <p><a name="Octahedron"></a></p>

  <p>IV. <i>The Octahedron.</i>&mdash;The simplest example of this is
  carbon (5 on <a href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>). We have again the funnel
  with its ovoids, but now there are eight funnels opening on the eight
  faces of the octahedron. In titanium (6 on <a href="#PlateIII">Plate
  III</a>) the form is masked by the protruding arms, which give the
  appearance of the old Rosicrucian Cross and Rose, but when we look into
  the details later, the carbon type comes out clearly. Zirconium is
  exactly like titanium in form, but contains a large number of atoms. We
  did not examine the remaining two members of this group. The group is
  tetratomic and positive. Its negative pendant shows the same form in
  silicon, germanium and tin; again, the fourth was unexamined.</p>

  <p><a name="PlateIV"></a></p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">

      alt="Plate IV." /></a>
    <font class="sc">Plate IV</font>.
  </div>
  <p>V. <i>The Bars.</i>&mdash;These characterise a set of closely allied
  groups, termed "inter-periodic." Fourteen bars (or seven crossed) radiate
  from a centre, as in iron (1 on Plate IV), and the members of each
  group&mdash;iron, nickel, cobalt; ruthenium, rhodium, palladium; osmium,
  iridium, platinum&mdash;differ from each other by the weight of each bar,
  increasing in orderly succession; the details will be given later.
  Manganese is often grouped with iron, nickel, and cobalt (<i>see</i>
  Crookes' lemniscates), but its fourteen protruding bodies repeat the
  "lithium spike" (proto-element 5) and are grouped round a central ovoid.
  This would appear to connect it with lithium (2 on Plate IV) rather than
  with fluorine (3 in Plate IV), with which it is often classed. The
  "lithium spike" re-appears in potassium and rubidium. These details,
  again, will come out more clearly later.</p>

  <p>VI. <i>The Star.</i>&mdash;A flat star, with five interpenetrating
  tetrahedra in the centre, is the characteristic of neon and its allies (4
  on Plate IV) leaving apart helium, which, as may be seen by referring to
  3, Plate IV, has an entirely different form.</p>

  <p>There are thus six clearly defined forms, typical of classes, with
  two&mdash;lithium and fluorine&mdash;of doubtful affinities. It is worthy
  of notice that in diatomic elements <i>four</i> funnels open on the faces
  of tetrahedra; in triatomic, <i>six</i> funnels on the faces of cubes; in
  tetratomic, <i>eight</i> funnels on the faces of octahedra.</p>

  <p>Thus we have a regular sequence of the platonic solids, and the
  question suggests itself, will further evolution develop elements shaped
  to the dodecahedron and the icosahedron?</p>

<h3>II.</h3>

  <p>We now pass from the consideration of the outer forms of the chemical
  elements to a study of their internal structure, the arrangement within
  the element of more or less complicated
  groups&mdash;proto-elements&mdash;capable of separate, independent
  existence; these, once more, may be dissociated into yet simpler
  groups&mdash;hyper-meta-proto-elements&mdash;equally capable of separate,
  independent existence, and resolvable into single ultimate physical
  atoms, the irreducible substratum of the physical world (see
  <i>Theosophist</i>, 1908, pp. 354-356).<a name="NtA_18"
  href="#Nt_18"><sup>[18]</sup></a></p>

  <p>We shall have to study the general internal structure, and then the
  breaking up of each element, and the admirable diagrams, patiently worked
  out by Mr. Jinarâjadâsa, will make the study comparatively easy to carry
  on.</p>

  <p>The diagrams, of course, can only give a very general idea of the
  facts they represent; they give groupings and show relations, but much
  effort of the imagination is needed to transform the two-dimensional
  diagram into the three-dimensional object. The wise student will try to
  visualize the figure from the diagram. Thus the two triangles of hydrogen
  are not in one plane; the circles are spheres, and the atoms within them,
  while preserving to each other their relative positions, are in swift
  movement in three-dimensional space. Where five atoms are seen, as in
  bromine and iodine, they are generally arranged with the central atom
  above the four, and their motion indicates lines which erect four plane
  triangles&mdash;meeting at their apices&mdash;on a square base, forming a
  square-based four-sided pyramid. Each dot represents a single ultimate
  atom. The enclosing lines indicate the impression of form made on the
  observer, and the groupings of the atoms; the groups will divide along
  these lines, when the element is broken up, so that the lines have
  significance, but they do not exist as stable walls or enclosing films,
  but rather mark limits, not lines, of vibrations. It should be noted that
  it is not possible to show five of the prisms in the five intersecting
  tetrahedra of prisms, and 30 atoms must, therefore, be added in
  counting.</p>

  <p>The diagrams are not drawn to scale, as such drawing would be
  impossible; the dot representing the atom is enormously too large
  compared with the enclosures, which are absurdly too small; a scale
  drawing would mean an almost invisible dot on a sheet of many yards
  square.</p>

  <p>The use of the words "positive" and "negative" needs to be guarded by
  the following paragraphs from the article on "Chemistry" in the
  <i>Encyclopædia Britannica</i>. We use the words in their ordinary
  text-book meaning, and have not, so far, detected any characteristics
  whereby an element can be declared, at sight, to be either positive or
  negative:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"When binary compounds, or compounds of two elements, are decomposed
  by an electric current, the two elements make their appearance at
  opposite poles. These elements which are disengaged at the negative pole
  are termed electro-positive or positive or basylous elements, while those
  disengaged at the positive pole are termed electro-negative or negative
  or chlorous elements. But the difference between these two classes of
  elements is one of degree only, and they gradually merge into each other;
  moreover the electric relations of elements are not absolute, but vary
  according to the state of combination in which they exist, so that it is
  just as impossible to divide the elements into two classes according to
  this property as it is to separate them into two distinct classes of
  metals and non-metals."</p>

  <p>We follow here the grouping according to external forms, and the
  student should compare it with the groups marked in the lemniscate
  arrangement shown in Article II (p. 377, properly p. 437, February),
  reading the group by the disks that fall below each other; thus the first
  group is H, Cl, Br, I (hydrogen, chlorine, bromine, iodine) and a blank
  for an undiscovered element. The elements grow denser in descending
  order; thus hydrogen is an invisible gas; chlorine a denser gas visible
  by its colour; bromine is a liquid; iodine is a solid&mdash;all, of
  course, when temperature and pressure are normal. By the lowering of
  temperature and the increase of pressure, an element which is normally
  gaseous becomes a liquid, and then a solid. Solid, liquid, gaseous, are
  three interchangeable states of matter, and an element does not alter its
  constitution by changing its state. So far as a chemical "atom" is
  concerned, it matters not whether it be drawn for investigation from a
  solid, a liquid, or a gas; but the internal arrangements of the "atoms"
  become much more complicated as they become denser and denser, as is seen
  by the complex arrangements necessitated by the presence of the 3546
  ultimate atoms contained in the chemical "atom" of gold, as compared with
  the simple arrangement of the 18 ultimate atoms of hydrogen.</p>

  <p>According to the lemniscate arrangement, we should commence with
  hydrogen as the head of the first negative group, but as it differs
  wholly from those placed with it, it is better to take it by itself.
  Hydrogen is the lightest of the known elements, and is therefore taken as
  1 in ordinary chemistry, and all atomic weights are multiples of this. We
  take it as 18, because it contains eighteen ultimate atoms, the smallest
  number we have found in a chemical element. So our "number-weights" are
  obtained by dividing the total number of atoms in an element by 18 (see
  p. 349, January).</p>

<font class="sc">Hydrogen</font> (Plate V, 1).&mdash;Hydrogen not only stands apart
from its reputed group by not having the characteristic dumb-bell
shape, well shown in sodium (<a href="#PlateI">Plate I</a>, opposite p. 349,
January), but it also stands apart in being positive, serving as a
base, not as a chlorous, or acid, radical, thus "playing the part
of a metal," as in hydrogen chloride (hydrochloric acid), hydrogen
sulphate (sulphuric acid), etc.

  <p>It is most curious that hydrogen, oxygen and nitrogen, the most widely
  spread gases, all differ fundamentally in form from the groups they
  reputedly head.<a name="NtA_19" href="#Nt_19"><sup>[19]</sup></a>
  Hydrogen was the first chemical element examined by us, nearly thirteen
  years ago, and I reproduce here the substance of what I wrote in
  November, 1895, for we have nothing to add to nor amend in it.</p>

  <p>Hydrogen consists of six small bodies, contained in an egg-like form
  (the outer forms are not given in the diagrams). The six little bodies
  are arranged in two sets of three, forming two triangles which are not
  interchangeable, but are related to each other as object and image. The
  six bodies are not all alike; they each contain three ultimate physical
  atoms, but in four of the bodies the three atoms are arranged in a
  triangle, and in the remaining two in a line.</p>

  bromine and iodine); they are monads, diamagnetic and negative.</p>

<font class="sc">Chlorine</font> (<a href="#PlateV">Plate V</a>, 2).&mdash;As already said, the general form is
that of the dumb-bell, the lower and upper parts each consisting
of twelve funnels, six sloping upwards and six downwards, the
funnels radiating outwards from a central globe, and these two
parts being united by a connecting rod (see, again, sodium,
<a href="#PlateI">Plate I</a>).

  <p>The funnel (shown flat as an isosceles triangle, standing on its apex)
  is a somewhat complicated structure, of the same type as that in sodium
  (<a href="#PlateVI">Plate VI, 2</a>), the difference consisting in the
  addition of one more globe, containing nine additional atoms. The central
  globe is the same as in sodium, but the connecting rod differs. We have
  here a regular arrangement of five globes, containing three, four, five,
  four, three atoms respectively, whereas sodium has only three bodies,
  containing four, six, four. But copper and silver, its congeners, have
  their connecting rods of exactly the same pattern as the chlorine rod,
  and the chlorine rod reappears in both bromine and iodine. These close
  similarities point to some real relation between these groups of
  elements, which are placed, in the lemniscates, equi-distant from the
  central line, though one is on the swing which is going towards that line
  and the other is on the swing away from it.</p>

<font class="sc">Bromine</font> (<a href="#PlateV">Plate V</a>, 3).&mdash;In bromine, each funnel has three
additional bodies, ovoid in shape, an addition of 33 atoms being
thus made without any disturbance of form; two pairs of atoms
are added to the central globe, and a rearrangement of the atoms
is effected by drawing together and lessening the swing of the
pair of triplets, thus making symmetrical room for the newcomers.
The connecting rod remains unchanged. The total
number of atoms is thus raised from the 639 of chlorine to 1439.
Over and over again, in these investigations, were we reminded
of Tyndall's fascinating description of crystal building, and his
fancy of the tiny, ingenious builders busied therein. Truly are
there such builders, and the ingenuity and effectiveness of their
devices are delightful to see.<a name="NtA_20" href="#Nt_20"><sup>[20]</sup></a>

  <p>The plan underlying the building up of groups is here clearly shown; a
  figure is built up on a certain plan, in this case a dumb-bell; in the
  succeeding members of the group additional atoms are symmetrically
  introduced, modifying the appearance, but following the general idea; in
  this case the connecting rod remains unaltered, while the two ends become
  larger and larger, more and more overshadowing it, and causing it to
  become shorter and thicker. Thus a group is gradually formed by
  additional symmetrical additions. In the undiscovered remaining member of
  the group we may suppose that the rod will have become still more
  egg-like, as in the case of gold.</p>

  <p>I <i>b</i>.&mdash;The corresponding positive group to that which we
  have been considering consists of Na, Cu, Ag, and Au (sodium, copper,
  silver and gold), with an empty disk between silver and gold, showing
  where an element ought to be. These four elements are monads,
  diamagnetic, and positive, and they show the dumb-bell arrangement,
  although it is much modified in gold; we may presume that the
  undiscovered element between silver and gold would form a link between
  them.</p>

the dumb-bell group. Its twelve funnels show only four enclosed
bodies, the same as we see in chlorine, bromine, iodine,
copper and silver, and which is very little modified in gold. Its
central globe is the simplest of all, as is its connecting rod.
We may therefore take it that sodium is the ground-plan of the
whole group.

additional enclosed bodies, thus raising the number of atoms in
a funnel from the sixteen of sodium to forty-five. The number
in the central globe is doubled, and we meet for the first time
the peculiar cigar or prism-shaped six-atomed arrangement, that
is one of the most common of atomic groups. It ought to

<font class="sc">Gold</font> (Plate VII) is so complicated that it demands a whole

characteristic groupings appear. The egg is the enormously
swollen connecting rod, and the upper and lower parts with
their central globes are the almond-like projections above and
below, with the central ovoid. Round each almond is a shadowy
funnel (not drawn in the diagram), and within the almond is the
collection of bodies shown in <i>e</i>, wherein the two lowest bodies
are the same as in every other member of the negative and
positive groups; the third, ascending, is a very slight modification
of the other thirds; the fourth is a union and re-arrangement
of the fourth and fifth; the fifth, of four ovoids, adds one to the
three ovoids of bromine, iodine and silver; the triangular group
is like that in copper and silver, though with 28 atoms instead of

The central body in the ovoid is very complicated, and is shown

  <p>Occultum was observed by us in 1895, and, finding that it was so
  light, and so simple in its composition, we thought that it might be
  helium, of which we were unable, at the time, to obtain a sample. When,
  however, helium itself came under observation in 1907, it proved to be
  quite different from the object before observed, so we dubbed the
  unrecognised object Occultum, until orthodox science shall find it and

  <p>We here meet the tetrahedron for the first time, with each angle
  occupied by a six-atomed group, the atoms arranged as on the end
  triangles of a prism. This form recurs very often, and was noted, last
  month, as seen in copper (<a href="#PlateVI">Plate VI</a>, 3); it
  revolves with extreme rapidity around its longitudinal axis, and looks
  like a pencil sharpened at both ends, or a cigar tapering at both ends;
  we habitually spoke of it as "the cigar." It appears to be strongly
  coherent, for, as will be seen below, its six atoms remain attached to
  each other as meta-compounds and even when divided into two triplets as
  hyper-compounds, they revolve round each other.</p>

  <p>Above the tetrahedron is a balloon-shaped figure, apparently drawn
  into shape by the attraction of the tetrahedron. The body below the
  tetrahedron looks like a coil of rope, and contains fifteen atoms; they
  are arranged on a slanting disk in a flat ring, and the force goes in at
  the top of one atom, and out of the bottom of it into the top of the
  next, and so on, making a closed circuit. The two little spheres, each
  containing a triplet, are like fill-up paragraphs to a
  compositor&mdash;they seem to be kept standing and popped in where
  wanted. The sphere marked <i>x</i> is a proto-compound, the balloon when
  set free.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Dissociation of Atoms</font>.</p>

  <p>Before proceeding to the study of other chemical atoms, as to their
  general internal arrangements, it is desirable to follow out, in those
  already shown, the way in which these atoms break up into simpler forms,
  yielding successively what we have called proto-, meta-, and
  hyper-compounds. It is naturally easier to follow these in the simpler
  atoms than in the more complex, and if the earlier dissociations are
  shown, the latter can be more readily and more intelligibly
  described.</p>

  <p>The first thing that happens on removing a gaseous atom from its
  "hole" (see pp. 21 to 23) or encircling "wall," is that the contained
  bodies are set free, and, evidently released from tremendous pressure,
  assume spherical or ovoid forms, the atoms within each re-arranging
  themselves, more or less, within the new "hole" or "wall." The figures
  are, of course, three-dimensional, and often remind one of crystals;
  tetrahedral, octagonal, and other like forms being of constant
  occurrence. In the diagrams of the proto-compounds, the constituent atoms
  are shown by dots. In the diagrams of the meta-compounds the dot becomes
  a heart, in order to show the resultants of the lines of force. In the
  diagrams of the hyper-compounds the same plan is followed. The letters
  <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, &amp;c., enable the student to follow the
  breaking up of each group through its successive stages.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Hydrogen</font> (<a href="#PlateV">Plate V</a>, 1).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">

      alt="Dissociation of Hydrogren." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The six bodies contained in the gaseous atom instantaneously
  re-arrange themselves within two spheres; the two linear triplets unite
  with one triangular triplet, holding to each other relative positions
  which, if connected by three right lines, would form a triangle with a
  triplet at each angle; the remaining three triangular triplets similarly
  arrange themselves in the second sphere. These form the proto-compounds
  of hydrogen.</p>

  <p>In the dissociation of these, each group breaks up into two, the two
  linear triplets joining each other and setting free their triangular
  comrade, while two of the triangular triplets similarly remain together,
  casting out the third, so that hydrogen yields four meta-compounds.</p>

  <p>In the hyper-condition, the connexion between the double triplets is
  broken, and they become four independent groups, two like ix, in the
  hyper-types (<a href="#Hyper">p. 25</a>), and two remaining linear, but
  rearranging their internal relations; the two remaining groups break up
  into two pairs and a unit.</p>

  <p>The final dissociation sets all the atoms free.</p>

      alt="Dissociation of Occultum." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>On the first dissociation of the component parts of occultum, the
  tetrahedron separates as a whole, with its four "cigars," flattening
  itself out within its hole, <i>a</i>; two "cigars" are positive and two
  negative, marked respectively <i>a</i> and <i>a'</i>. The rope becomes a
  ring within a sphere, <i>b</i>, and the two bodies <i>d</i> <i>d</i>,
  which are loose in the gaseous atom, come within this ring. The balloon
  becomes a sphere.</p>

  <p>On further dissociation, the "cigars" go off independently, showing
  two types, and these again each divide into triplets, as meta-compounds.
  <i>B</i>, on the meta-level, casts out the two <i>d</i> bodies, which
  become independent triplets, and the "rope" breaks into two, a close ring
  of seven atoms and a double cross of eight. These subdivide again to form
  hyper-compounds, the ring yielding a quintet and a pair, and the double
  cross separating into its two parts.</p>

  <p>The balloon, <i>c</i>, becomes much divided, the cohesion of its parts
  being slight; it forms two triplets, a pair and a unit, and these set
  free, on further dissociation, no less than five separate atoms and two
  duads.</p>

  <p>The two triplets of <i>d</i> each cast out an atom on dissociation,
  and form two pairs and two units.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Sodium</font> (<a href="#PlateVI">Plate VI</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>It is convenient to consider sodium next, because it is the basic
  pattern on which not only copper, silver and gold are formed, but also
  chlorine, bromine and iodine.</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-018.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-018.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Sodium." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>When sodium is set free from its gaseous condition, it divides up into
  thirty-one bodies&mdash;twenty-four separate funnels, four bodies derived
  from the two central globes, and three from the connecting rod. The
  funnels become spheres, and each contains four enclosed spheres, with
  more or less complicated contents. Each central globe yields a sextet and
  a quartet, and the rod sets free two quartets and a peculiarly formed
  sextet.</p>

  <p>When the proto-compounds are dissociated, the funnel-sphere sets free:
  (1) the contents of <i>a</i>, rearranged into two groups of four within a
  common sphere; the sphere yields four duads as hyper-compounds; (2) the
  contents of <i>b</i>, which unite themselves into a quartet, yielding two
  duads as hyper-compounds; and (3) the contents of the two spheres,
  <i>c</i>, which maintain their separation as meta-compounds, and become
  entirely independent, the atoms within the sphere revolving round each
  other, but the spheres ceasing their revolution round a common axis, and
  going off in different directions. The atoms break off from each other,
  and gyrate in independent solitude as hyper-"compounds." Thus each funnel
  yields finally ten hyper-bodies.</p>

  <p>The part of the central globe, marked <i>d</i>, with its six atoms,
  whirling round a common centre, becomes two triplets, at the meta-stage,
  preparing for the complete separation of these as hyper-bodies. The
  second part of the same globe, marked <i>e</i>, a whirling cross, with an
  atom at each point, becomes a quartet in the meta-state, in which three
  atoms revolve round a fourth, and in the hyper-state this central atom is
  set free, leaving a triplet and a unit.</p>

  <p>Each of the two bodies marked <i>f</i>, liberated from the connecting
  rod, shows four atoms whirling round a common centre, exactly resembling
  <i>e</i> in appearance; but there must be some difference of inner
  relations, for, in the meta-state, they re-arrange themselves as two
  pairs, and divide into two as hyper-bodies.</p>

  <p>The body marked <i>g</i> is a four-sided pyramid, with two closely
  joined atoms at its apex; these still cling to each in mutual revolution
  as a meta-body, encircled by a ring of four, and this leads to a further
  dissociation into three pairs on the hyper-level.</p>

      alt="Dissociation of Chlorine and Bromine." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The description of the funnel of sodium applies to that of chlorine,
  until we come to the body nearest the mouth, the sphere containing three
  additional bodies; this remains within the funnel in the first
  dissociation, so that again we have twenty-four separate funnels as
  proto-compounds; the central globes are the same as in sodium, and yield
  the same four bodies; the connecting rod sets free five bodies, of which
  two are the same; we have thus thirty-three separate bodies as the result
  of the dissociation of chlorine into its proto-compounds. As all the
  compounds which are in sodium break up in the same way into meta- and
  hyper-compounds, we need not repeat the process here. We have only to
  consider the new meta- and hyper-compounds of the highest sphere within
  the funnel, and the two triplets and one quintet from the connecting
  rod.</p>

  <p>The additional body within the proto-funnel is of a very simple
  character, three contained triangles within the flattened sphere. On
  release from the funnel, on the meta-level, the atoms rearrange
  themselves in a whirling set of three triplets, and these break off from
  each other as hyper-compounds. The two triplets from the connecting rod,
  also, are of the simplest character and need not delay us. The
  five-atomed body, a four-sided pyramid as a proto-compound, becomes a
  ring whirling round a centre on the meta, and two pairs with a unit on
  the hyper.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Bromine</font> (<a href="#PlateV">Plate V</a>, 3).</p>

  <p>Three additional bodies appear at the top of the funnel, which
  otherwise repeats that of chlorine. The connecting rod is the same and
  may be disregarded. The central globes become more complex. The additions
  are, however, of very easy types, and hence are readily dealt with. Each
  of the three similar ovoid bodies contains two triplets&mdash;each a
  triangle and a quintet&mdash;a four-sided pyramid. These are the same, as
  may be seen in the connecting rod of chlorine, and we need not repeat
  them. Only the globe remains. This does not break up as a proto-compound
  but is merely set free, <i>a</i> and the 2 <i>bs</i> whirling in a plane
  vertical to the paper and the two smaller bodies, <i>cc</i>, whirling on
  a plane at right angles to the other. These two disengage themselves,
  forming a quartet as a meta-compound, while <i>a</i> makes a whirling
  cross and <i>bb</i> a single sextet; these further dissociate themselves
  into four pairs and two triplets.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Iodine has nothing new to give us, except five similar ovoid bodies at
  the top of each funnel, and two quartets instead of two pairs in the
  central globe. The ovoid bodies become spheres when the funnels are
  thrown off, and a crystalline form is indicated within the sphere. The
  atoms are arranged in two tetrahedra with a common apex, and the
  relationship is maintained in the meta-body, a septet. The latter breaks
  up into two triplets and a unit on the hyper-level. In the central
  globes, the <i>a</i> of bromine is repeated twice instead of the pairs in
  <i>cc</i>.</p>

  <p><a name="DisCu"></a></p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Copper</font> (<a href="#PlateVI">Plate VI</a>, 3).</p>

  <p>We have already disposed of occultum, on this plate, and of sodium,
  which lies at the root of both groups. Copper, we now find, is also very
  largely off our hands, as the funnel provides us with only two new
  types&mdash;two spheres&mdash;each containing five atoms in a new
  arrangement, and the triangular body at the mouth with its ten atoms.
  This triangular body, with an increased number of atoms, reappears in
  various other chemical elements. The central globes are different from
  any we have had before, in their internal arrangement, but the
  constituents are familiar; there are two contained spheres with four
  atoms each, the <i>a</i> in the globe of bromine (see above) and 2
  "cigars." The "cigars" may be followed under occultum (see above). The
  connecting rod is as in chlorine, bromine and iodine.</p>

  <p>The atoms in the bodies <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> are curiously arranged.
  <i>A</i> consists of two square-based pyramids turned so as to meet at
  their apices, and breaks up into two quartet rings and a duad. <i>B</i>
  is again two four-sided pyramids, but the bases are in contact and set at
  right angles to each other; the second apex is not seen, as it is
  directly below the first. The pyramids separate as meta-bodies, and the
  atoms assume the peculiar arrangement indicated and then break up into
  four pairs and two units on the hyper level.</p>

  <p>Silver presents us with only two new bodies, and even these are only
  new by slight additions to old models. The triangular shaped body at the
  apex of the funnel, containing 21 atoms, is intermediate between the
  similar bodies in copper and iron. As a proto-element it becomes three
  triangles, joined at their apices, in fact a tetrahedron in which no
  atoms are distributed on the fourth face. The faces separate on the meta
  level and give three seven-atomed figures, and each of these breaks up
  into two triplets and a unit. The central globe only differs from that of
  bromine by the addition of one atom, which gives the familiar four-sided
  pyramid with a square base as in chlorine (see <a href="#DisCl">p.
  46</a>).</p>

  </div>
  <p>The disintegration of gold first yields forty-seven bodies on the
  proto-level; the twenty-four funnels separate, and the central globes
  which hold each twelve together set free their six contained globes
  (<i>c</i>, <i>d</i>), thirty bodies being thus liberated. The sixteen
  bodies on the central inclined planes, marked <i>b</i>, break away, their
  central globe, with its four contained globes, remaining unchanged. But
  this condition does not last. The motion of the funnels changes and thus
  the funnels cease to exist and their contents are set free, each funnel
  thus liberating nine independent bodies; the sixteen <i>b</i> separate
  into two each; the four <i>a</i> liberate five each; the two <i>c</i> set
  free thirteen each; the four <i>d</i> finally liberate two each: 302
  proto elements in all.</p>

  <p>The funnel is almost that of iodine, re-arranged. Four of the first
  ring in the iodine funnel are replaced by the triangular body, which
  becomes a four-sided pyramid with an occupied base. The second ring of
  three ovoids in iodine becomes four in gold, but the internal arrangement
  of each ovoid is the same. The next two spheres in the iodine funnel
  coalesce into one sphere, with similar contents, in the gold funnel. The
  fifth in iodine is slightly rearranged to form the fourth in descent in
  gold, and the remaining two are the same. <i>B</i> has been broken up
  under occultum (<a href="#DisOc">p. 628</a>) and can be followed there.
  The sixteen rings set free from the four <i>a</i>, after gyrating round
  the central body, now become a sphere, break up, as in occultum (see <a
  href="#DisOc">p. 44</a>) into a meta seven-atomed ring and an
  eight-atomed double cross, and so on to the hyper level. The sphere with
  its two contained bodies breaks up into eight triangles on the meta
  level, and each of these, on the hyper, into a duad and a unit. The
  twelve septets of <i>c</i> assume the form of prisms as in iodine (see <a
  href="#DisI">p. 48</a>) and pursue the same course, while its central
  body, a four-sided pyramid with its six attendants, divides on the meta
  level into six duads, revolving round a ring with a central atom as in
  chlorine (<a href="#DisCl">p. 47</a>), the duads going off independently
  on the hyper-level and the ring breaking up as in chlorine. The "cigar"
  tetrahedron of <i>d</i> follows its course as in occultum, and the other
  sets free two quartets and two triplets on the meta level, yielding six
  duads and two units as hyper compounds. It will be seen that, complex as
  gold is, it is composed of constituents already familiar, and has iodine
  and occultum as its nearest allies.</p>

makes the containing body spherical instead of ovoid; similar

on the top of those on the other, so that the ten become in

leaving eleven duads on each side. The composition is, however,
much better seen by flattening out the whole. On the

the tetrahedron; the funnel is widened by the arrangement of
its contents, three spheres forming its first ring, as compared
with the units in beryllium and calcium, and the pairs in strontium
and molybdenum. Two of these spheres are identical in their
contents&mdash;two quintets (7 <i>f</i>), a quintet (7 <i>j</i>), and two quintets
(7 <i>e</i>), <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> being to each other as object and image. The
remaining sphere (7 <i>b</i>) is identical with the highest in the
calcium funnel. The remaining two spheres, one below the
other, are identical with the corresponding two spheres in
calcium. The central globe, as regards its external segments,
is again identical with that of calcium, but in the internal
segments a six-atomed triangle (7 <i>k</i>) is substituted for the calcium
four-atomed one (7 <i>e</i>).

differing from it only in the composition of the highest pair of

<font class="sc">Magnesium</font> (<a href="#PlateIX">Plate IX</a>, 1) introduces us to a new arrangement:
each group of three ovoids forms a ring, and the three rings are
within a funnel; at first glance, there are three bodies in the
funnel; on examination each of these is seen to consist of three,
with other bodies, spheres, again within them. Apart from this,
the composition is simple enough, all the ovoids being alike, and
composed of a triplet, a septet and a duad.

Then we see four spikes, alternating with the funnels and
pointing to the angles, each adding 144 atoms to the total. The
spikes show the ten-atomed triangle, already met with in other
metals, three very regular pillars, each with six spheres, containing
two, three, four, four, three, two atoms, respectively. The
supporting spheres are on the model of the central globe, but
contain more atoms. Funnels and spikes alike radiate from a
simple central globe, in which five contained spheres are arranged
crosswise, preparing for the fully developed cross of cadmium.
The ends of the cross touch the bottoms of the funnels.

light falls upon it. It is known that the conductivity of selenium
varies with the intensity of the light falling upon it, and it may
be that the star is in some way connected with its conductivity.
It will be seen that the star is a very complicated body, and in
each of its six points the two five-atomed spheres revolve round
the seven-atomed cone. The bodies in the funnels resemble
those in magnesium, but a reversed image of the top one is
interposed between itself and the small duad, and each pair has

<h3>V.</h3>

  <p>We must now consider the ways in which the members of the tetrahedral
  groups break up, and as we proceed with this study we shall find how
  continual are the repetitions, and how Nature, with a limited number of
  fundamental methods, creates by varied combinations her infinite variety
  of forms.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Beryllium</font> (<a href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>, 2, and
<a href="#PlateVIII">VIII</a>, 1).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-025.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-025.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Beryllium and Calcium." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Beryllium offers us four similar funnels and a central globe, and the
  proto-elements consist of these five bodies, set free. The funnel,
  released from pressure, assumes a spherical form, with its four ovoids
  spinning within it, and the central globe remains a sphere, containing a
  whirling cross. On the meta level, the ovoids are set free, and two from
  each funnel are seen to be positive, two negative&mdash;sixteen bodies in
  all, <i>plus</i> the cross, in which the resultant force-lines are
  changed, preparatory to its breaking into two duads on the hyper level.
  On that level, the decades disintegrate into two triplets and a quartet,
  the positive with the depressions inward, the negative with the
  depressions outward.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Calcium</font> (<a href="#PlateVIII">Plate VIII</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>The funnels, as usual, assume a spherical form on the proto level, and
  show, in each case, three spheres containing ovoids. These spheres, still
  on the proto level, break free from their containing funnel, as in the
  case of gold (<a href="#DisAu">p. 49</a>), twelve bodies being thus
  liberated, while the central globe breaks up into eight segments, each of
  which becomes globular, and contains within it a "cigar" and a somewhat
  heart-shaped body. Four spheres, each containing seven ten-atomed ovoids,
  are identical with those in beryllium, and can be followed in its
  diagram. Eight spheres, each containing five nine-atomed ovoids of a
  different type, set free, on the meta level, eighty duads&mdash;forty
  positive and forty negative&mdash;and forty quintets, which are identical
  with those in chlorine. On the hyper level, the duads become single
  atoms, within a sphere, and the central atom from the quintet is also set
  free, one hundred and twenty in all. The remaining four atoms of the
  quintet divide into two duads.</p>

  <p>The central globe, dividing into eight, becomes eight six-atomed
  spheres on the meta, the "cigar" behaving as usual, four "cigars" being
  positive and four negative, and becoming dissociated into triplets; the
  four atoms within the heart-shaped body appear as a tetrahedron, remain
  together on the meta level, and break up into duads on the hyper.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Strontium</font> (<a href="#PlateVIII"><font class="sc">Plate VIII</font></a>, 3).</p>

  <p>The third member of this group repeats the <i>a</i> groups of
  beryllium and the <i>b</i> groups of calcium, and they dissociate into
  the bodies already described under these respectively. The two upper
  globes in each funnel repeat each other, but each globe contains four
  smaller spheres showing three varieties of forms. The two marked
  <i>g</i>, which are repeated in the central globe as <i>h</i>, are
  seven-atomed, and appear as spheres or ovoids according to pressure. They
  are figured on <a href="#DisI">p. 48</a>, under iodine; <i>e</i> and
  <i>f</i> are related as object and image, and we have already seen them
  in copper (<a href="#CompCu">pp. 38</a> and <a href="#DisCu">48</a>); in
  each case, as in copper, they unite into a ten-atomed figure; on the meta
  level the pair of fours form a ring, and the remaining two atoms form a
  duad; <i>i</i>, which repeats <i>f</i>, makes a ring with the fifth in
  the centre, as in the five-atomed <i>b</i> of calcium, as shown above.
  There is, thus, nothing new in strontium, but only repetitions of forms
  already studied.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Oxygen</font> (<a href="#PlateVIII"><font class="sc">Plate VIII</font></a>, 4).</p>

  </div>
  <p>The disintegration of oxygen as given in 1895 may be repeated here,
  and the better presentation given on <a href="#CompO">p. 54</a> renders
  it easier to follow the process. On the proto level the two "snakes"
  divide; the brilliant disks are seven-atomed, but are differently
  arranged, the positive snake having the atoms arranged as in the iodine
  ovoids, whereas the negative snake has them arranged as in a capital H.
  The snakes show the same extraordinary activity on the proto level as on
  the gaseous, twisting and writhing, darting and coiling. The body of the
  snake is of two-atomed beads, positive and negative. On the meta level
  the snakes break into ten fragments, each consisting of a disk, with six
  beads on one side and five on the other, remaining as lively as the
  original snake. They shiver into their constituent disks, and beads on
  the hyper level, there yielding the ten disks, five positive and five
  negative, and the 110 beads, fifty-five positive and fifty-five
  negative.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Chromium</font> (<a href="#PlateVIII"><font class="sc">Plate VIII</font></a>, 5).</p>

  <p>When we go on to chromium and molybdenum, we return to our familiar
  funnels and central globes, and the secondary spheres within the
  funnels&mdash;quickly set free, as before, on the proto level&mdash;give
  us no new combinations in their contained spheres and ovoids. The
  <i>a</i> of beryllium, the <i>b</i> of calcium and strontium, and
  <i>d</i> of calcium, the <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> of strontium, are all
  there; <i>j</i> in chromium is the same as the central sphere in the
  <i>b</i> ovoid. In the central globe, <i>k</i>, is a pair of triangles as
  in hydrogen, consisting of only six atoms, which on the meta level
  revolve round each other, and break up into two duads and two units on
  the hyper.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Molybdenum</font> (<a href="#PlateVIII"><font class="sc">Plate VIII</font></a>, 6).</p>

  <p>Molybdenum presents us with only two new forms, and these are merely
  four-atomed tetrahedra, occurring in pairs as object and image. All the
  other bodies have already been analysed.</p>

  <p>II <i>a</i>.&mdash;We come now to the second great tetrahedral group,
  which though very much complicated, is yet, for the most part, a
  repetition of familiar forms.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Magnesium</font> (<a href="#PlateIX"><font class="sc">Plate IX</font></a>, 1).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-027.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-027.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Magnesium and Zinc." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>We are still among tetrahedra, so have to do with four funnels, but
  each funnel contains three rings, and each ring three ovoids; on the
  proto level a triple dissociation takes place, for the funnels let free
  the rings as large spheres, in each of which rotate three twelve-atomed
  ovoids, and then the ovoids break loose from the spheres, and themselves
  become spherical, so that we have finally thirty-six proto compounds from
  the tetrahedron. On the meta level the contained bodies, a triplet, Mg
  <i>a</i>, a septet, Mg <i>b</i>, and a duad, Mg <i>c</i>, are set free
  from each globe, thus yielding one hundred and eight meta compounds. On
  the hyper level the triplet becomes a duad and a unit; the duad becomes
  two units; and the septet a triplet and a quartet.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Zinc</font> (<a href="#PlateIX"><font class="sc">Plate IX</font></a>, 2).</p>

  <p>We can leave aside the funnel, for the only difference between it and
  the magnesium funnel is the substitution of a second septet for the
  triplet, and the septet is already shown in the magnesium diagram. We
  have, therefore, only to consider the spikes, pointing to the angles of
  the enclosing tetrahedron, and the central globe. These are set free on
  the proto level and the spikes immediately release their contents,
  yielding thus thirty-two separate bodies.</p>

  <p>The triangular arrangement at the top of the spike is the same as
  occurs in copper (<i>b</i> on <a href="#DisCu">p. 48</a>), and can be
  there followed. One of the three similar pillars is shown in the
  accompanying diagram under Zn <i>a</i>. The compressed long oval becomes
  a globe, with six bodies revolving within it in a rather peculiar way:
  the quartets turn round each other in the middle; the triplets revolve
  round them in a slanting ellipse; the duads do the same on an ellipse
  slanting at an angle with the first, somewhat as in gold (<i>a</i> and
  <i>b</i>, <a href="#CompAu">p. 40</a>). The spheres within the globes at
  the base of the spikes, Zn <i>b</i>, behave as a cross&mdash;the cross is
  a favourite device in the II <i>a</i> groups. Finally, the central globe,
  Zn <i>c</i>, follows the same cruciform line of disintegration.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Cadmium</font> (<a href="#PlateIX">Plate IX</a>, 3).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-028.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-028.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Cadmium and Tellurium." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Cadmium follows very closely on the lines of zinc; the pillars of the
  zinc spike are reproduced in the rings of the cadmium funnel; the globes
  are also the globes of cadmium; so neither of these needs attention. We
  have only to consider the three ten-atomed ovoids, which are substituted
  for the one ten-atomed triangle of zinc, and the central cross. The
  ovoids become spheres (Cd <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>), the contained bodies
  revolving within them, <i>a</i> whirling on a diameter of the sphere,
  cutting it in halves, as it were, and <i>b</i> whirling round it at right
  angles; the cross also becomes a sphere (Cd <i>c</i>), but the cruciform
  type is maintained within it by the relative positions of the contained
  spheres in their revolution. The subsequent stages are shown in the
  diagram.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Sulphur</font> (<a href="#PlateXI">Plate XI</a>, 1).</p>

  <p>Sulphur has nothing new, but shows only the funnels already figured in
  magnesium, with the substitution of a second septet for the triplet, as
  in zinc.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Selenium</font> (<a href="#PlateX">Plate X</a>, 2).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-029.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-029.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Selenium." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>The funnel of selenium is a re-arrangement of the twelve-atomed ovoids
  of magnesium and the ten-atomed ovoids of cadmium. The funnels, on
  disintegrating, set free twelve groups, each containing nine spheres. On
  the meta level the ten-atomed bodies are set free, and the twelve-atomed
  divide into duads and decads, thus yielding seventy-two decads and
  thirty-six duads; the duads, however, at once recombine into hexads, thus
  giving only twelve meta elements, or eighty-four in all from the funnels.
  The central globe holds together on the proto level, but yields five meta
  elements. The star also at first remains a unit on the proto level, and
  then shoots off into seven bodies, the centre keeping together, and the
  six points becoming spheres, within which the two cones, base to base,
  whirl in the centre, and the globes circle round them. On the meta level
  all the thirty bodies contained in the star separate from each other, and
  go on their independent ways.</p>

  <p>Selenium offers a beautiful example of the combination of simple
  elements into a most exquisite whole.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Tellurium</font> (<a href="#PlateX">Plate X</a>, 3).</p>

  <p>Tellurium very closely resembles cadmium, and they are, therefore
  placed on the same diagram. The pillars are the same as in chlorine and
  its congeners, with a duad added at the base. The ten-atomed ovoid is the
  same as in cadmium and follows the same course in breaking up. It would
  be interesting to know why this duad remains as a duad in selenium and
  breaks up into a septad and triad in the other members of the group. It
  may be due to the greater pressure to which it is subjected in selenium,
  or there may be some other reason. The cross in tellurium is identical
  with that in cadmium, except that the centre is seven-atomed instead of
  four-atomed.</p>

  of nitrogen, vanadium and niobium; they are triatomic, paramagnetic, and
  negative. We have not examined the remaining members of these groups. In
  these two groups nitrogen dominates, and in order to make the comparison
  easy the nitrogen elements are figured on both <a href="#PlateXI">Plate
  XI</a> and <a href="#PlateXII">Plate XII</a>. It will be seen that
  scandium and yttrium, of the positive group, differ only in details from
  vanadium and niobium, of the negative group; the ground-plan on which
  they are built is the same. We noted a similar close resemblance between
  the positive strontium and the negative molybdenum.</p>

We have here the
simplest form of the cube; the funnels contain only five bodies&mdash;four
six-atomed ovoids and one six-atomed "cigar." The
central globe has but four five-atomed spheres. It is as simple
in relation to its congeners as is beryllium to its group-members.

<font class="sc">Scandium</font> (<a href="#PlateXI">Plate XI</a>, 2). For the first time we meet funnels
of different types, A and B, three of each kind; A appear
to be positive and B negative, but this must be stated with
reserve.

  <p>In A the boron funnel is reproduced, the "cigar" having risen above
  its companion ovoids; but the most important matter to note in respect to
  this funnel is our introduction to the body marked <i>a</i> 110. This
  body was observed by us first in nitrogen, in 1895, and we gave it the
  name of the "nitrogen balloon," for in nitrogen it takes the balloon
  form, which it also often assumes in other gaseous elements. Here it
  appears as a sphere&mdash;the form always assumed on the proto
  level&mdash;and it will be seen, on reference to the detailed diagram 4
  <i>a</i>, to be a complicated body, consisting of six fourteen-atomed
  globes arranged round a long ovoid containing spheres with three, four,
  six, six, four, three, atoms respectively. It will be observed that this
  balloon appears in every member of these two groups, except boron.</p>

  <p>The B funnel runs largely to triads, <i>c</i> and <i>b</i>, <i>b</i>
  (see 4 <i>b</i>) having not only a triadic arrangement of spheres within
  its contained globes, but each sphere has also a triplet of atoms. In
  <i>c</i> (see 4 <i>c</i>) there is a triadic arrangement of spheres, but
  each contains duads. B is completed by a five-atomed sphere at the top of
  the funnel. It should be noted that <i>a</i>, <i>b</i> and <i>c</i> all
  are constituents of nitrogen.</p>

  <p>The central globe repeats that of boron, with an additional
  four-atomed sphere in the middle.</p>

<font class="sc">Yttrium</font> (<a href="#PlateXI">Plate XI</a>, 3). Here we have a quite new arrangement
of bodies within the funnel&mdash;the funnel being of one type
only. Two "cigars" whirl on their own axes in the centre near
the top, while four eight-atomed globes (see 4 <i>e</i>) chase each
other in a circle round them, spinning madly on their own axes&mdash;this
axial spinning seems constant in all contained bodies&mdash;all
the time. Lower down in the funnel, a similar arrangement is
seen, with a globe (see 4 <i>d</i>)&mdash;a nitrogen element&mdash;replacing the
"cigars," and six-atomed ovoids replacing the globes.

  <p>The "nitrogen balloon" occupies the third place in the funnel, now
  showing its usual shape in combination, while the <i>b</i> globe (see 4
  <i>b</i>) of scandium takes on a lengthened form below it.</p>

  <p>The central globe presents us with two tetrahedra, recalling one of
  the combinations in gold (see <a href="#PlateVII">Plate VII</a>
  <i>d</i>), and differing from that only by the substitution of two
  quartets for the two triplets in gold.</p>

  <p>One funnel of yttrium contains exactly the same number of atoms as is
  contained in a gaseous atom of nitrogen. Further, <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, and
  <i>d</i> are all nitrogen elements. We put on record these facts, without
  trying to draw any conclusions from them. Some day, we&mdash;or
  others&mdash;may find out their significance, and trace through them
  obscure relations.</p>

  <p>The corresponding negative group, of nitrogen, vanadium and niobium,
  is rendered particularly interesting by the fact that it is headed by
  nitrogen, which&mdash;like the air, of which it forms so large a
  part&mdash;pervades so many of the bodies we are studying. What is there
  in nitrogen which renders it so inert as to conveniently dilute the fiery
  oxygen and make it breathable, while it is so extraordinarily active in
  some of its compounds that it enters into the most powerful explosives?
  Some chemist of the future, perhaps, will find the secret in the
  arrangement of its constituent parts, which we are able only to
  describe.</p>

our 1895 investigations, I quote from them. The balloon-shaped
body (see 4 <i>a</i>) floats in the middle of the egg, containing six
small spheres in two horizontal rows, and a long ovoid in the
midst; this balloon-shaped body is positive, and is drawn down
towards the negative body <i>b</i> (see 4 <i>b</i>) with its seven contained
spheres, each of which has nine atoms within it&mdash;three triads.
Four spheres are seen, in addition to the two larger bodies; two
of these (see 4 <i>d</i>), each containing five smaller globes, are
positive, and two (see 4 <i>c</i>) containing four smaller globes, are
negative.

types of funnels. Funnel A only differs from that of scandium by
having a globe (see 4 <i>d</i>) inserted in the ring of four ovoids; funnel
B has a six-atomed, instead of a five-atomed globe at the top, and
slips a third globe containing twenty atoms (see 4 <i>d</i>) between the
two identical with those of scandium (see 4 <i>c</i>). The central
globe has seven atoms in its middle body instead of four.
In this way does vanadium succeed in overtopping scandium

  </div>
  <p>The disintegration of boron is very simple: the funnels are set free
  and assume the spherical form, showing a central "cigar" and four globes
  each containing two triplets. The central globe is also set free with its
  four quintets, and breaks at once in two. On the meta level the "cigar"
  breaks up as usual, and the triplets separate. On the hyper level, the
  "cigar" follows its usual course, and the triplets become duads and
  units. The globe forms two quintets on the meta level, and these are
  resolved into triplets and duads.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Scandium</font> (<a href="#PlateXI">Plate XI</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>In funnel A the "cigar" and the ovoids behave as in boron, but the
  "balloon," <i>a</i> 110 (<a href="#PlateXI">XI</a>, 4), escapes from the
  funnel as it changes to a sphere, and holds together on the proto level;
  on the meta, it yields six globes each containing seven duads, and these
  are all set free as duads on the hyper level; the ovoid is also set free
  on the meta level becoming a sphere, and on the hyper level liberates its
  contained bodies, as two triplets, two quartets and two sextets.</p>

  <p>In funnel B there is a quintet, that behaves like those in the globe
  of boron, on escaping from the funnel, in which the bodies remain on the
  proto level, with the exception of <i>b</i> 63, which escapes. On the
  meta level, <i>c</i> (<a href="#PlateXI">Plate XI</a>, 4), <i>c</i>
  assumes a tetrahedral form with six atoms at each point, and these hold
  together as sextets on the hyper level. At the meta stage, <i>b</i> (<a
  href="#PlateXI">Plate XI</a>, 4 <i>b</i>) sets free seven nine-atomed
  bodies, which become free triplets on the hyper. The central globe shows
  a cross at its centre, with the four quintets whirling round it, on the
  proto level. On the meta, the quintets are set free, and follow the boron
  type, while the cross becomes a quartet on the meta level, and two duads
  on the hyper.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Yttrium</font> (<a href="#PlateXI">Plate XI</a>, 3).</p>

  </div>
  <p>In yttrium, on the proto level, <i>a</i> 110 and <i>b</i> 63 both
  escape from the funnel, and behave as in scandium. The ovoids and
  "cigars," set free on the meta level, behave as in boron. The central
  globe breaks up as in gold (<a href="#DisAu">pp. 49</a> and 50), four
  quartets being set free instead of two quartets and two triplets. We have
  only to consider <i>e</i> 8 and <i>d</i> 20 (<a href="#PlateXI">Plate
  XI</a>, 4). <i>E</i> 8 is a tetrahedral arrangement of duads on the meta
  level, set free as duads on the hyper. <i>D</i> 20 is an arrangement of
  pairs of duads at the angles of a square-based pyramid on the meta, and
  again free duads on the hyper.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Nitrogen</font> (<a href="#PlateXII">Plate XII</a>, 1).</p>

  <p>Nitrogen has nothing new to show us, all its constituents having
  appeared in scandium and yttrium.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Vanadium</font> (<a href="#PlateXII">Plate XII</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>The A funnel of vanadium repeats the A funnel of scandium, with the
  addition of <i>d</i> 20, already studied. In the B funnel scandium B is
  repeated, with an addition of <i>d</i> 20 and a sextet for a quintet; the
  sextet is the <i>c</i> of the "nitrogen balloon." The central globe
  follows boron, save that it has a septet for its centre; this was figured
  in iodine (<a href="#DisI">p. 48</a>).</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Niobium</font> (<a href="#PlateXII">Plate XII</a>, 3).</p>

  <p>Niobium only differs from yttrium by the introduction of triplets for
  duads in <i>e</i>; on the meta level we have therefore triplets, and on
  the hyper each triplet yields a duad and a unit. The only other
  difference is in the central globe. The tetrahedra separate as usual, but
  liberate eight "cigars" instead of four with four quartets; the central
  body is simple, becoming three triads at the angles of a triangle on the

  </div>
  <p>The funnels let go the globes, but the eight ovoids remain within
  them, so that seven bodies are let loose on the proto level. When the
  ovoids are set free at the meta stage they become spherical and a
  nine-atomed body is produced, which breaks up into triangles on the hyper
  level. The globe becomes a cross at the meta stage, with one atom from
  the duads at each arm in addition to its own, and these form four duads
  on the hyper, and a unit from the centre.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Gallium</font> (<a href="#PlateXIII">Plate XIII</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>In gallium the funnel disappears on the proto level, setting free its
  two contained segments, each of which forms a cylinder, thus yielding
  twelve bodies on the proto level. On the meta, the three upper globes in
  each left-hand segment are set free, and soon vanish, each liberating a
  cigar and two septets, the quartet and triad uniting. On the hyper the
  quartet yields two duads but the triangle persists. The second set of
  bodies divide on the meta level, forming a sextet and a cross with a duad
  at each arm; these on the hyper level divide into two triangles, four
  duads and a unit. The seven-atomed cone becomes two triangles united by a
  single atom, and on the meta level these form a ring round the unit; on
  the hyper they form three duads and a unit.</p>

  <p>In the right-hand segment, the same policy is followed, the four
  triads becoming two sextets, while the central body adds a third to the
  number. The second ring has a quartet instead of the sextet, but
  otherwise breaks up as does that of the left; the quintet at the base
  follows that of boron.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Indium</font> (<a href="#PlateXIII">Plate XIII</a>, 3).</p>

  <p>The complication of three segments of different types in each funnel
  does not affect the process of breaking up, and indium needs little
  attention. A is exactly the same as the left-hand funnel of gallium, save
  for the substitution of a globe containing the familiar "cigar" and two
  square-based pyramids. B is the same as the right-hand funnel of gallium,
  except that its lowest body consists of two square-based pyramids and a
  tetrahedron. All these are familiar.</p>

  </div>
  <p>The atoms in the six similar spheres in the segments of the phosphorus
  funnel are arranged on the eight angles of a cube, and the central one is
  attached to all of them. On the meta level five of the nine atoms hold
  together and place themselves on the angles of a square-based pyramid;
  the remaining four set themselves on the angle of a tetrahedron. They
  yield, on the hyper level, two triads, a duad, and a unit. The remaining
  bodies are simple and familiar.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Arsenic</font> (<a href="#PlateXIV">Plate XIV</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>Arsenic shows the same ovoids and globe as have already been broken up
  in aluminium (see <a href="#DisAl"><i>ante</i></a>); the remaining
  sixteen spheres form nine-atomed bodies on the meta level, all similar to
  those of aluminium, thus yielding twelve positive and twelve negative;
  the globe also yields a nine-atomed body, twenty-five bodies of nine.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Antimony</font> (<a href="#PlateXIV">Plate XIV</a>, 3).</p>

  <p>Antimony follows closely in the track of gallium and indium, the upper
  ring of spheres being identical. In the second ring, a triplet is
  substituted for the unit, and this apparently throws the cross out of
  gear, and we have a new eleven-atomed figure, which breaks up into a
  triplet and two quartets on the hyper level. The lowest seven-atomed
  sphere of the three at the base is the same as we met with in copper.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">IV.&mdash;<font class="sc">The Octahedral Groups.</font></p>

  <p>These groups are at the turns of the spiral in Sir William Crookes'
  lemniscates (see <a href="#Crookes">p. 28</a>). On the one side is
  carbon, with below it titanium and zirconium; on the other silicon, with
  germanium and tin. The characteristic form is an octahedron, rounded at
  the angles and a little depressed between the faces in consequence of the
  rounding; in fact, we did not, at first, recognize it as an octahedron,
  and we called it the "corded bale," the nearest likeness that struck us.
  The members of the group are all tetrads, and have eight funnels, opening
  on the eight faces of the octahedron. The first group is paramagnetic and
  positive; the corresponding one is diamagnetic and negative. The two
  groups are not closely allied in composition, though both titanium and
  tin have in common the five intersecting tetrahedra at their respective
  centres.</p>

<font class="sc">Carbon</font> (<a href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>, 5, and
<a href="#PlateXV">XV</a>, 1) gives us the fundamental
octahedral form, which becomes so masked in titanium and
zirconium. As before said (<a href="#Octahedron">p. 30</a>),
the protrusion of the arms in
these suggests the old Rosicrucian symbol of the cross and rose,
but they show at their ends the eight carbon funnels with their
characteristic contents, and thus justify their relationship. The
funnels are in pairs, one of each pair showing three "cigars,"
and having as its fellow a funnel in which the middle "cigar"
is truncated, thus loosing one atom. Each "cigar" has a leaf-like
body at its base, and in the centre of the octahedron is a
globe containing four atoms, each within its own wall; these lie
on the dividing lines of the faces, and each holds a pair of the
funnels together. It seems as though this atom had been
economically taken from the "cigar" to form a link. This will
be more clearly seen when we come to separate the parts from
each other. It will be noticed that the atoms in the "leaves" at
the base vary in arrangement, being alternately in a line and in a
triangle.

  <p>Here, for the first time, we find ourselves a little at issue with the
  accepted system of chemistry. Fluorine stands at the head of a
  group&mdash;called the inter-periodic&mdash;whereof the remaining members
  are (see Crookes' table, <a href="#Crookes">p. 28</a>), manganese, iron,
  cobalt, nickel; ruthenium, rhodium, palladium; osmium, iridium, platinum.
  If we take all these as group V, we find that fluorine and manganese are
  violently forced into company with which they have hardly any points of
  relationship, and that they intrude into an otherwise very harmonious
  group of closely similar composition. Moreover, manganese reproduces the
  characteristic lithium "spike" and not the bars of those into whose
  company it is thrust, and it is thus allied with lithium, with which
  indeed it is almost identical. But lithium is placed by Crookes at the
  head of a group, the other members of which are potassium, rubidium and
  cæsium (the last not examined). Following these identities of
  composition, I think it is better to remove manganese and fluorine from
  their incongruous companions and place them with lithium and its allies
  as V <i>a</i>, the Spike Groups, marking, by the identity of number,
  similarities of arrangement which exist, and by the separation the
  differences of composition. It is worth while noting what Sir William
  Crookes, in his "Genesis of the Elements," remarks on the relations of
  the interperiodic group with its neighbours. He says: "These bodies are
  interperiodic because their atomic weights exclude them from the small
  periods into which the other elements fall, and because their chemical
  relations with some members of the neighbouring groups show that they are
  probably interperiodic in the sense of being in transition stages."</p>

  <p>Group V in every case shows fourteen bars radiating from a centre as
  shown in iron, <a href="#PlateIV">Plate IV</a>, 1. While the form remains
  unchanged throughout, the increase of weight is gained by adding to the
  number of atoms contained in a bar. The group is made up, not of single
  chemical elements, as in all other cases, but of sub-groups, each
  containing three elements, and the relations within each sub-group are
  very close; moreover the weights only differ by two atoms per bar, making
  a weight difference of twenty-eight in the whole. Thus we have per
  bar:&mdash;</p>

  <p>The third sub-group, osmium, iridium and platinum, is, of course, more
  complicated in its composition, but its builders succeed in preserving
  the bar form, gaining the necessary increase by a multiplication of
  contained spheres within the ovoids. Osmium has one peculiarity: the
  ovoid marked <i>a</i> (<a href="#PlateXVIII">XVIII</a>, 4) takes the
  place of axis in the upper half of the bar, and the three ovoids, marked
  <i>b</i>, revolve round it. In the lower half, the four ovoids, <i>c</i>,
  revolve round the central axis. In platinum, we have marked two forms as
  platinum A and platinum B, the latter having two four-atomed spheres (<a
  href="#PlateXVIII">XVIII</a>, 6 <i>b</i>) in the place of the two
  triplets marked <i>a</i>. It may well be that what we have called
  platinum B is not a variety of platinum, but a new element, the addition
  of two atoms in a bar being exactly that which separates the other
  elements within each of the sub-groups. It will be noticed that the four
  lower sections of the bars are identical in all the members of this
  sub-group, each ovoid containing thirty atoms. The upper ring of ovoids
  in iridium and platinum A are also identical, but for the substitution,
  in platinum A, of a quartet for a triplet in the second and third ovoids;

  <p>I place within this group lithium, potassium, rubidium, fluorine, and
  manganese, because of their similarity in internal composition. Manganese
  has fourteen spikes, arranged as in the iron group, but radiating from a
  central globe. Potassium has nine, rubidium has sixteen, in both cases
  radiating from a central globe. Lithium (<a href="#PlateIV">Plate IV</a>,
  2) and fluorine (<a href="#PlateIV">Plate IV</a>, 3) are the two types
  which dominate the group, lithium supplying the spike which is reproduced
  in all of them, and fluorine the "nitrogen balloon" which appears in all
  save lithium. It will be seen that the natural affinities are strongly
  marked. They are all monads and paramagnetic; lithium, potassium and
  rubidium are positive, while fluorine and manganese are negative. We seem
  thus to have a pair, corresponding with each other, as in other cases,
  and the interperiodic group is left interperiodic and congruous within
  itself.</p>

spike revolves swiftly on its axis, carrying the petals with it; the
plate revolves equally swiftly in the opposite direction. Within
the spike are two globes and a long ovoid; the spheres within
the globe revolve as a cross; within the ovoid are four spheres
containing atoms arranged on tetrahedra, and a central sphere
with an axis of three atoms surrounded by a spinning wheel of six.

<h3>IX.</h3>

  <p>We have now to consider the breaking up of the octahedral groups, and
  more and more, as we proceed, do we find that the most complicated
  arrangements are reducible to simple elements which are already
  familiar.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Carbon</font> (<a href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>, 5, and <a href="#PlateXV">XV</a>, 1).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-043.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-043.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Carbon." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Carbon is the typical octahedron, and a clear understanding of this
  will enable us to follow easily the constitution and disintegration of
  the various members of these groups. Its appearance as a chemical atom is
  shown on <a href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>, and see <a
  href="#PlateXV">XV</a>, 1. On the proto level the chemical atom breaks up
  into four segments, each consisting of a pair of funnels connected by a
  single atom; this is the proto element which appears at the end of each
  arm of the cross in titanium and zirconium. On the meta level the five
  six-atomed "cigars" show two neutral combinations, and the truncated
  "cigar" of five atoms is also neutral; the "leaves" yield two forms of
  triplet, five different types being thus yielded by each pair of funnels,
  exclusive of the linking atom. The hyper level has triplets, duads and
  units.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Titanium</font> (<a href="#PlateIII">Plate III</a>, 6, and <a href="#PlateXV">XV</a>, 2, 3).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-044.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-044.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Titanium and Zirconium." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>On the proto level, the cross breaks up completely, setting free the
  pairs of funnels with the linking atom (<i>a</i> and <i>b</i>), as in
  carbon, the four bodies marked <i>c</i>, the twelve marked <i>d</i>, and
  the central globe marked <i>e</i>. The latter breaks up again, setting
  free its five intersecting cigar-bearing tetrahedra, which follow their
  usual course (see Occultum, <a href="#DisOc">p. 44</a>). The eight-atomed
  body in the centre makes a ring of seven atoms round a central one, like
  that in occultum (see p. 44, diagram B), from which it only differs in
  having the central atom, and breaks up similarly, setting the central
  atom free. The ovoid <i>c</i> sets free its four contained globes, and
  the ovoid <i>d</i> sets free the three within it. Thus sixty-one proto
  elements are yielded by titanium. On the meta level, <i>c</i> (titanium
  3) breaks up into star-like and cruciform bodies; the component parts of
  these are easily followed; on the hyper level, of the four forms of
  triplets one behaves as in carbon, and the others are shown, <i>a</i>,
  <i>b</i> and <i>f</i>; the cruciform quintet yields a triplet and a duad,
  <i>c</i> and <i>d</i>; the tetrahedra yield two triplets <i>g</i> and
  <i>h</i>, and two units; the septet, a triplet <i>k</i> and a quartet
  <i>j</i>. On the meta level, the bodies from <i>d</i> behave like their
  equivalents in sodium, each <i>d</i> shows two quartets and a sextet,
  breaking up, on the hyper level, into four duads and two triads.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Zirconium</font> (<a href="#PlateXV">Plate XV</a>, 2, 5).</p>

  <p>Zirconium reproduces in its <i>c</i> the four forms that we have
  already followed in the corresponding <i>c</i> of titanium, and as these
  are set free on the proto level, and follow the same course on the meta
  and hyper levels, we need not repeat them. The central globe of zirconium
  <i>c</i> sets free its nine contained bodies; eight of these are similar
  and are figured in the diagram; it will be observed that the central body
  is the truncated "cigar" of carbon; their behaviour on the meta and hyper
  levels is easily followed there. The central sphere is also figured; the
  cigar follows its usual course, and its companions unite into a sextet
  and an octet. The <i>d</i> ovoid liberates five bodies, four of which we
  have already seen in titanium, as the crosses and sextet of sodium, and
  which are figured under titanium; the four quartets within the larger
  globe also follow a sodium model, and are given again.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Silicon</font> (<a href="#PlateXVI">Plate XVI</a>, 1).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-045.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-045.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Silicon and Tin." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>In silicon, the ovoids are set free from the funnels on the proto
  level, and the truncated "cigar," playing the part of a leaf, is also
  liberated. This, and the four "cigars," which escape from their ovoids,
  pass along their usual course. The quintet and quartet remain together,
  and form a nine-atomed body on the meta level, yielding a sextet and a
  triplet on the hyper.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Germanium</font> (<a href="#PlateXVI">Plate XVI</a>, 2, 4).</p>

  <p>The central globe, with its two "cigar"-bearing tetrahedra, need not
  delay us; the tetrahedra are set free and follow the occultum
  disintegration, and the central four atoms is the sodium cross that we
  had in titanium. The ovoids (<a href="#PlateXVI">XVI</a>, 4) are
  liberated on the proto level, and the "cigar," as usual, bursts its way
  through and goes along its accustomed path. The others remain linked on
  the meta level, and break up into two triangles and a quintet on the
  hyper.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Tin</font> (<a href="#PlateXVI">Plate XVI</a>, 3, 4).</p>

  <p>Here we have only the spike to consider, as the funnels are the same
  as in germanium, and the central globe is that of titanium, omitting the
  eight atomed centre. The cone of the spike we have had in silver (see <a
  href="#DisAg">p. 729</a>, May), and it is set free on the proto level.
  The spike, as in zinc, becomes a large sphere, with the single septet in
  the centre, the remaining six bodies circling round it on differing
  planes. They break up as shown. (Tin is Sn.)</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Iron</font> (<a href="#PlateIV">Plate IV</a>, I, and <a href="#PlateXVII">XVII</a>, 3).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">

      alt="Dissociation of Iron, Cobalt and Nickel." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>We have already dealt with the affinities of this peculiar group, and
  we shall see, in the disintegration, even more clearly, the close
  relationships which exist according to the classification which we here
  follow.</p>

  <p>The fourteen bars of iron break asunder on the proto level, and each
  sets free its contents&mdash;a cone and three ovoids, which as usual,
  become spheres. The twenty-eight-atomed cone becomes a four-sided figure,
  and the ovoids show crystalline contents. They break up, on the meta
  level as shown in the diagram, and are all reduced to triplets and duads
  on the hyper level.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Cobalt</font> (<a href="#PlateXVII">Plate XVII</a>, 4).</p>

  <p>The ovoids in cobalt are identical with those of iron; the higher
  ovoids, which replace the cone of iron, show persistently the crystalline
  forms so noticeable throughout this group.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Nickel</font> (<a href="#PlateXVII">Plate XVII</a>, 5).</p>

  <p>The two additional atoms in a bar, which alone separate nickel from
  cobalt, are seen in the upper sphere of the central ovoid.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Ruthenium</font> (<a href="#PlateXVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, 1).</p>

  <p>The lower ovoids in ruthenium are identical in composition, with those
  of iron, cobalt and nickel and may be studied under Iron. The upper ones
  only differ by the addition of a triplet.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Rhodium</font> (<a href="#PlateXVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>Rhodium has a septet, which is to be seen in the <i>c</i> of titanium
  (see <i>k</i> in the titanium diagram) and differs only in this from its
  group.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Palladium</font> (<a href="#PlateXVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, 3).</p>

  <p>In palladium this septet appears as the upper sphere in every ovoid of
  the upper ring.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Osmium</font> (<a href="#PlateXVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, 4).</p>

  <p>We have here no new constituents; the ovoids are set free on the proto
  level and the contained globes on the meta, all being of familiar forms.
  The cigars, as usual, break free on the proto level, and leave their
  ovoid with only four contained spheres, which unite into two nine-atomed
  bodies as in silicon (see above).</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Iridium</font> (<a href="#PlateXVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, 5.)</p>

  <p>The twenty-one-atomed cone of silver here reappears, and its
  proceedings may be followed under that metal (see diagram, <a
  href="#DisAg">p. 729</a>, May). The remaining bodies call for no
  remark.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Platinum</font> (<a href="#PlateXVIII">Plate XVIII</a>, 6).</p>

  <p>Again the silver cone is with us. The remaining bodies are set free on
  the proto level, and their contained spheres on the meta.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Lithium</font> (<a href="#PlateIV">Plate IV</a>, 2, and <a href="#PlateXIX">XIX</a>, 1).</p>

  <div class="figright" style="width:50%;">
      <a href="images/oc-047.png" target="_blank"><img width="100%" src="images/oc-047.png"
      alt="Dissociation of Lithium." /></a>
  </div>
  <p>Here we have some new combinations, which recur persistently in its
  allies. The bodies <i>a</i>, in Plate XIX, 1, are at the top and bottom
  of the ellipse; they come to right and left of it in the proto state, and
  each makes a twelve-atomed body on the meta level.</p>

  <p>The five bodies within the ellipse, three monads and two sextets, show
  two which we have had before: <i>d</i>, which behaves like the quintet
  and quartet in silicon, after their junction, and <i>b</i>, which we have
  had in iron. The two bodies <i>c</i> are a variant of the square-based
  pyramid, one atom at the apex, and two at each of the other angles. The
  globe, <i>e</i>, is a new form, the four tetrahedra of the proto level
  making a single twelve-atomed one on the meta. The body <i>a</i> splits
  up into triplets on the hyper; <i>b</i> and <i>d</i> follow their iron
  and silicon models; <i>c</i> yields four duads and a unit; <i>e</i>
  breaks into four quartets.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Potassium</font> (<a href="#PlateXIX">Plate XIX</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>Potassium repeats the lithium spike; the central globe shows the
  "nitrogen balloon," which we already know, and which is surrounded on the
  proto level with six tetrahedra, which are set free on the meta and
  behave as in cobalt. Hence we have nothing new.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Rubidium</font> (<a href="#PlateXIX">Plate XIX</a>, 3).</p>

  <p>Again the lithium spike, modified slightly by the introduction of an
  ovoid, in place of the top sphere; the forms here are somewhat unusual,
  and the triangles of the sextet revolve round each other on the meta
  level; all the triads break up on the hyper level into duads and
  units.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Fluorine</font> (<a href="#PlateIV">Plate IV</a>, 3, and Plate <a href="#PlateXVII">XVII</a>, 1).</p>

  <p>The reversed funnels of fluorine split asunder on the proto level, and
  are set free, the "balloons" also floating off independently. The
  funnels, as usual, become spheres, and on the meta level set free their
  contained bodies, three quartets and a triplet from each of the eight.
  The balloons disintegrate in the usual way.</p>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;"><font class="sc">Manganese</font> (<a href="#PlateXVII">Plate XVII</a>, 2).</p>

  <p>Manganese offers us nothing new, being composed of "lithium spikes"
  and "nitrogen balloons."</p>

  <p>We have now reached the last of the groups as arranged on Sir William
  Crookes' lemniscates, that forming the "neutral" column; it is headed by
  helium, which is <i>sui generis</i>. The remainder are in the form of a
  flat star (see <a href="#PlateIV">Plate IV</a>, 4), with a centre formed
  of five intersecting and "cigar"-bearing tetrahedra, and six radiating
  arms. Ten of these have been observed, five pairs in which the second
  member differs but slightly from the first; they are: Neon, Meta-neon;
  Argon, Metargon; Krypton, Meta-krypton; Xenon, Meta-xenon; Kalon,
  Meta-kalon; the last pair and the meta forms are not yet discovered by

  <p>It does not seem worth while to break up these elements, for their

  110, <i>b</i> 63 and <i>c</i> 120&mdash;have all been fully dealt with in

  <p>There remains now only radium, of the elements which we have, so far,
  examined, and that will be now described and will bring to an end this
  series of observations. A piece of close and detailed work of this kind,
  although necessarily imperfect, will have its value in the future, when
  science along its own lines shall have confirmed these researches.</p>

  <p>It will have been observed that our weights, obtained by counting, are
  almost invariably slightly in excess of the orthodox ones: it is
  interesting that in the latest report of the International Commission
  (November 13, 1907), printed in the <i>Proceedings of the Chemical
  Society of London</i>, Vol. XXIV, No. 33, and issued on January 25, 1908,
  the weight of hydrogen is now taken at 1.008 instead of at 1. This would
  slightly raise all the orthodox weights; thus aluminium rises from 26.91
  to 27.1, antimony from 119.34 to 120.2, and so on.</p>

  <p>Radium has the form of a tetrahedron, and it is in the tetrahedral
  groups (see article <a href="#CompBe">IV</a>) that we shall find its
  nearest congeners; calcium, strontium, chromium, molybdenum resemble it
  most closely in general internal arrangements, with additions from zinc
  and cadmium. Radium has a complex central sphere (<a
  href="#PlateXXII">Plate XXII</a>), extraordinarily vivid and living; the
  whirling motion is so rapid that continued accurate observation is very
  difficult; the sphere is more closely compacted than the centre-piece in
  other elements, and is much larger in proportion to the funnels and
  spikes than is the case with the elements above named; reference to <a
  href="#PlateVIII">Plate VIII</a> will show that in these the funnels are
  much larger than the centres, whereas in radium the diameter of the
  sphere and the length of the funnel or spike are about equal. Its heart
  consists of a globe containing seven atoms, which assume on the proto
  level the prismatic form shown in cadmium, magnesium and selenium. This
  globe is the centre of two crosses, the arms of which show respectively
  three-atomed and two-atomed groups. Round this sphere are arranged, as on
  radii, twenty-four segments, each containing five bodies&mdash;four
  quintets and a septet&mdash;and six loose atoms, which float horizontally
  across the mouth of the segment; the whole sphere has thus a kind of
  surface of atoms. On the proto level these six atoms in each segment
  gather together and form a "cigar." In the rush of the streams presently
  to be described one of these atoms is occasionally torn away, but is
  generally, if not always, replaced by the capture of another which is
  flung into the vacated space.</p>

  <p>Each of the four funnels opens, as usual, on one face of the
  tetrahedron, and they resemble the funnels of strontium and molybdenum
  but contain three pillars instead of four (<a href="#PlateXXIII">Plate
  XXIII</a>). They stand within the funnel as though at the angles of a
  triangle, not side by side. The contained bodies, though numerous,
  contain forms which are all familiar.</p>

  <p>The spikes alternate with the funnels, and point to the angles of the
  tetrahedron as in zinc and cadmium; each spike contains three "lithium
  spikes" (see <a href="#PlateXIX">Plate XIX</a>) with a ten-atomed cone or
  cap at the top, floating above the three (<a href="#PlateXXIV">Plate
  XXIV</a>). The "petals" or "cigars" of lithium exist in the central globe
  in the floating atoms, and the four-atomed groups which form the lithium
  "plate" may be seen in the funnels, so that the whole of lithium appears
  in radium.</p>

  <p>So much for its composition. But a very peculiar result, so far
  unobserved elsewhere, arises from the extraordinarily rapid whirling of
  the central sphere. A kind of vortex is formed, and there is a constant
  and powerful indraught through the funnels. By this, particles are drawn
  in from without, and these are swept round with the sphere, their
  temperature becoming much raised, and they are then violently shot out
  through the spikes. It is these jets which occasionally sweep away an
  atom from the surface of the sphere. These "particles" may be atoms, or
  they may be bodies from any of the etheric levels; in some cases these
  bodies break up and form new combinations. In fact lithium seems like a
  kind of vortex of creative activity, drawing in, breaking up,
  recombining, shooting forth&mdash;a most extraordinary element.</p>

<h3>APPENDIX.</h3>

<p class="center" style="margin-top: 2em;">THE ÆTHER OF SPACE.</p>

  <p>Much discussion has taken place, especially between physicists and
  chemists, over the nature of the substances with which all space must,
  according to scientific hypothesis, be filled. One side contends that it
  is infinitely thinner than the thinnest gas, absolutely frictionless and
  without weight; the other asserts that it is denser than the densest
  solid. In this substance the ultimate atoms of matter are thought to
  float, like motes in a sunbeam, and light, heat and electricity are
  supposed to be its vibrations.</p>

  <p>Theosophical investigators, using methods not at the disposal of
  physical science, have found that this hypothesis includes under one head
  two entirely different and widely separated sets of phenomena. They have
  been able to deal with states of matter higher than the gaseous and have
  observed that it is by means of vibrations of this finer matter that
  light, heat and electricity manifest themselves to us. Seeing that matter
  in these higher states thus performs the functions attributed to the
  ether of science, they have (perhaps unadvisedly) called these states
  etheric, and have thus left themselves without a convenient name for that
  substance which fulfils the other part of the scientific
  requirements.</p>

  <p>Let us for the moment name this substance <i>koilon</i>, since it
  fills what we are in the habit of calling empty space. What mûlaprakrti,
  or "mother-matter," is to the inconceivable totality of universes, koilon
  is to our particular universe&mdash;not to our solar system merely but to
  the vast unit which includes all visible suns. Between koilon and
  mûlaprakrti there must be various stages, but we have at present no
  direct means of estimating their number or of knowing anything whatever
  about them.</p>

  <p>In an ancient occult treatise, however, we read of a "colorless
  spiritual fluid" "which exists everywhere and forms the first foundation
  on which our solar system is built. Outside the latter, it is found in
  its pristine purity only between the stars [suns] of the universe.... As
  its substance is of a different kind from that known on earth, the
  inhabitants of the latter, seeing <i>through it</i>, believe, in their
  illusion and ignorance, that it is empty space. There is not one finger's
  breadth of void space in the whole boundless universe."<a name="NtA_21"
  href="#Nt_21"><sup>[21]</sup></a> "The mother-substance" is said, in this
  treatise, to produce this æther of space as its seventh grade of density,
  and all objective suns are said to have this for their "substance."</p>

  <p>To any power of sight which we can bring to bear upon it, this koilon
  appears to be homogeneous, though it is probably nothing of the kind,
  since homogeneity can belong to the mother-substance alone. It is out of
  all proportion denser than any other substance known to us, infinitely
  denser&mdash;if we may be pardoned the expression; so much denser that it
  seems to belong to another type, or order, of density. But now comes the
  startling part of the investigation: we might expect matter to be a
  densification of this koilon; it is nothing of the kind. Matter is not
  koilon, but <i>the absence of koilon</i>, and at first sight, matter and
  space appear to have changed places, and emptiness has become solidity,
  solidity has become emptiness.</p>

  <p>To help us to understand this clearly let us examine the ultimate atom
  of the physical plane (see <a href="#UltAtom">pp. 21</a>-23). It is
  composed of ten rings or wires, which lie side by side, but never touch
  one another. If one of these wires be taken away from the atom, and be,
  as it were, untwisted from its peculiar spiral shape and laid out on a
  flat surface, it will be seen that it is a complete circle&mdash;a
  tightly twisted endless coil. This coil is itself a spiral containing
  1680 turns; it can be unwound, and it will then make a much larger
  circle. This process of unwinding may be again performed, and a still
  bigger circle obtained, and this can be repeated till the seven sets of
  spirillæ are all unwound, and we have a huge circle of the tiniest
  imaginable dots, like pearls threaded on an invisible string. These dots
  are so inconceivably small that many millions of them are needed to make
  one ultimate physical atom, and while the exact number is not readily
  ascertainable, several different lines of calculation agree in indicating
  it as closely approximate to the almost inconceivable total of fourteen
  thousand millions. Where figures are so huge, direct counting is
  obviously impossible, but fortunately the different parts of the atom are
  sufficiently alike to enable us to make an estimate in which the margin
  of error is not likely to be very great. The atom consists of ten wires,
  which divide themselves naturally into two groups&mdash;the three which
  are thicker and more prominent, and the seven thinner ones which
  correspond to the colors and planets. These latter appear to be identical
  in constitution though the forces flowing through them must differ, since
  each responds most readily to its own special set of vibrations. By
  actual counting it has been discovered that the numbers of coils or
  spirillæ of the first order in each wire is 1680; and the proportion of
  the different orders of spirillæ to one another is equal in all cases
  that have been examined, and correspond with the number of dots in the
  ultimate spirillæ of the lowest order. The ordinary sevenfold rule works
  quite accurately with the thinner coils, but there is a very curious
  variation with regard to the set of three. As may be seen from the
  drawings, these are obviously thicker and more prominent, and this
  increase of size is produced by an augmentation (so slight as to be
  barely perceptible) in the proportion to one another of the different
  orders of spirillæ and in the number of dots in the lowest. This
  augmentation, amounting at present to not more than .00571428 of the
  whole of each case, suggests the unexpected possibility that this portion
  of the atom may be somehow actually undergoing a change&mdash;may in fact
  be in process of growth, as there is reason to suppose that these three
  thicker spirals originally resembled the others.</p>

  <p>Since observation shows us that each physical atom is represented by
  forty-nine astral atoms, each astral atom by forty-nine mental atoms, and
  each mental atom by forty-nine of those on the buddhic plane, we have
  here evidently several terms of a regular progressive series, and the
  natural presumption is that the series continues where we are no longer
  able to observe it. Further probability is lent to this assumption by the
  remarkable fact that&mdash;if we assume one dot to be what corresponds to
  an atom on the seventh or highest of our planes (as is suggested in
  <i>The Ancient Wisdom</i>, p. 42) and then suppose the law of
  multiplication to begin its operation, so that 49 dots shall form the
  atom of the next or sixth plane, 2401 that of the fifth, and so
  on&mdash;we find that the number indicated for the physical atom
  (49<sup>6</sup>) corresponds almost exactly with the calculation based
  upon the actual counting of the coils. Indeed, it seems probable that but
  for the slight growth of the three thicker wires of the atom the
  correspondence would have been perfect.</p>

  <p>It must be noted that a physical atom cannot be directly broken up
  into astral atoms. If the unit of force which whirls those millions of
  dots into the complicated shape of a physical atom be pressed back by an
  effort of will over the threshold of the astral plane, the atom
  disappears instantly, for the dots are released. But the same unit of
  force, working now upon a higher level, expresses itself not through one
  astral atom, but through a group of 49. If the process of pressing back
  the unit of force is repeated, so that it energises upon the mental
  plane, we find the group there enlarged to the number of 2401 of those
  higher atoms. Upon the buddhic plane the number of atoms formed by the
  same amount of force is very much greater still&mdash;probably the cube
  of 49 instead of the square, though they have not been actually counted.
  Therefore one physical atom is not <i>composed of</i> forty-nine astral
  or 2401 mental atoms, but <i>corresponds</i> to them, in the sense that
  the force which manifests through it would show itself on those higher
  planes by energising respectively those numbers of atoms.</p>

  <p>The dots, or beads, seem to be the constituents of all matter of which
  we, at present, know anything; astral, mental and buddhic atoms are built
  of them, so we may fairly regard them as fundamental units, the basis of
  matter.</p>

  <p>These units are all alike, spherical and absolutely simple in
  construction. Though they are the basis of all matter, they are not
  themselves matter; they are not blocks but bubbles. They do not resemble
  bubbles floating in the air, which consist of a thin film of water
  separating the air within them from the air outside, so that the film has
  both an outer and an inner surface. Their analogy is rather with the
  bubbles that we see rising in water, before they reach the surface,
  bubbles which may be said to have only one surface&mdash;that of the
  water which is pushed back by the contained air. Just as such bubbles are
  not water, but are precisely the spots from which water is absent, so
  these units are not koilon, but the absence of koilon&mdash;the only
  spots where it is not&mdash;specks of nothingness floating in it, so to
  speak, for the interior of these space-bubbles is an absolute void to the
  highest power of vision that we can turn upon them.</p>

  <p>That is the startling, well-nigh incredible, fact. Matter is
  nothingness, the space obtained by pressing back an infinitely dense
  substance; Fohat "digs holes in space" of a verity, and the holes are the
  airy nothingnesses, the bubbles, of which "solid" universes are
  built.</p>

  <p>What are they, then, these bubbles, or rather, what is their content,
  the force which can blow bubbles in a substance of infinite density? The
  ancients called that force "the Breath," a graphic symbol, which seems to
  imply that they who used it had seen the kosmic process, had seen the
  <font class="sc">Logos</font> when He breathed into the "waters of
  space," and made the bubbles which build universes. Scientists may call
  this "Force" by what names they will&mdash;names are nothing; to us,
  Theosophists, it is the Breath of the <font class="sc">Logos</font>, we
  know not whether of the <font class="sc">Logos</font> of this solar
  system or of a yet mightier Being; the latter would seem the more likely,
  since in the above-quoted occult treatise all visible suns are said to
  have this as their substance.</p>

  <p>The Breath of the <font class="sc">Logos</font>, then, is the force
  which fills these spaces; His the force which holds them open against the
  tremendous pressure of the koilon; they are full of His Life, of Himself,
  and everything we call matter, on however high or low a plane, is
  instinct with divinity; these units of force, of life, the bricks with
  which He builds His universe, are His very life scattered through space;
  truly is it written: "I established this universe with a portion of
  myself." And when He draws in His breath, the waters of space will close
  in again, and the universe will have disappeared. It is only a
  breath.</p>

  <p>The outbreathing which makes these bubbles is quite distinct from, and
  long antecedent to, the three outpourings, or Life-Waves, so familiar to
  the theosophical student. The first Life-Wave catches up these bubbles,
  and whirls them into the various arrangements which we call the atoms of
  the several planes, and aggregates them into the molecules, and on the
  physical plane into the chemical elements. The worlds are built out of
  these voids, these emptinesses, which seem to us "nothing" but are divine
  force. It is matter made from the privation of matter. How true were
  H.P.B.'s statements in "The Secret Doctrine": "Matter is nothing but an
  aggregation of atomic forces" (iii, 398); "Buddha taught that the
  primitive substance is eternal and unchangeable. Its vehicle is the pure
  luminous æther, the boundless infinite space, not a void, resulting from
  the absence of all forms, but on the contrary, the foundation of all
  forms" (iii, 402).</p>

  <p>How vividly, how unmistakably this knowledge brings home to us the
  great doctrine of Mâyâ, the transitoriness and unreality of earthly
  things, the utterly deceptive nature of appearances! When the candidate
  for initiation sees (not merely believes, remember, but actually
  <i>sees</i>) that what has always before seemed to him empty space is in
  reality a solid mass of inconceivable density, and that the matter which
  has appeared to be the one tangible and certain basis of things is not
  only by comparison tenuous as gossamer (the "web" spun by
  "Father-Mother"), but is actually composed of emptiness and
  nothingness&mdash;is itself the very negation of matter&mdash;then for
  the first time he thoroughly appreciates the valuelessness of the
  physical senses as guides to the truth. Yet even more clearly still
  stands out the glorious certainty of the immanence of the Divine; not
  only is everything ensouled by the <font class="sc">Logos</font>, but
  even its visible manifestation is literally part of Him, is built of His
  very substance, so that Matter as well as Spirit becomes sacred to the
  student who really understands.</p>

  <p>The koilon in which all these bubbles are formed undoubtedly
  represents a part, and perhaps the principal part, of what science
  describes as the luminiferous æther. Whether it is actually the bearer of
  the vibrations of light and heat through interplanetary space is as yet
  undetermined. It is certain that these vibrations impinge upon and are
  perceptible to our bodily senses only through the etheric matter of the
  physical plane. But this by no means proves that they are conveyed
  through space in the same manner, for we know very little of the extent
  to which the physical etheric matter exists in interplanetary and
  interstellar space, though the examination of meteoric matter and kosmic
  dust shows that at least some of it is scattered there.</p>

  <p>The scientific theory is that the æther has some quality which enables
  it to transmit at a certain definite velocity transverse waves of all
  lengths and intensities&mdash;that velocity being what is commonly called
  the speed of light, 190,000 miles per second. Quite probably this may be
  true of koilon, and if so it must also be capable of communicating those
  waves to bubbles or aggregations of bubbles, and before the light can
  reach our eyes there must be a downward transference from plane to plane
  similar to that taking place when a thought awakens emotion or causes
  action.</p>

  <p>In a recent pamphlet on "The Density of Æther," Sir Oliver Lodge
  remarks:&mdash;</p>

  <p>"Just as the ratio of mass to volume is small in the case of a solar
  system or a nebula or a cobweb, I have been driven to think that the
  observed mechanical density of matter is probably an excessively small
  fraction of the total density of the substance or æther contained in the
  space which it thus partially occupies&mdash;the substance of which it
  may hypothetically be held to be composed.</p>

  <p>"Thus, for instance, consider a mass of platinum, and assume that its
  atoms are composed of electrons, or of some structures not wholly
  dissimilar: the space which these bodies actually fill, as compared with
  the whole space which in a sense they 'occupy,' is comparable to one
  ten-millionth of the whole, even inside each atom; and the fraction is
  still smaller if it refers to the visible mass. So that a kind of minimum
  estimate of ætherial density, on this basis, would be something like ten
  thousand million times that of platinum."</p>

  <p>And further on he adds that this density may well turn out to be fifty
  thousand million times that of platinum. "The densest matter known," he
  says, "is trivial and gossamer-like compared with the unmodified æther in
  the same space."</p>

  <p>Incredible as this seems to our ordinary ideas, it is undoubtedly an
  understatement rather than an exaggeration of the true proportion as
  observed in the case of koilon. We shall understand how this can be so if
  we remember that koilon seems absolutely homogeneous and solid even when
  examined by a power of magnification which makes physical atoms appear in
  size and arrangement like cottages scattered over a lonely moor, and when
  we further add to this the recollection that the bubbles of which these
  atoms in turn are composed are themselves what may be not inaptly called
  fragments of nothingness.</p>

  <p>In the same pamphlet Sir Oliver Lodge makes a very striking estimate
  of the intrinsic energy of the æther. He says: "The total output of a
  million-kilowatt power station for thirty million years exists
  permanently, and at present inaccessibly in every cubic millimetre of
  space." Here again he is probably underestimating the stupendous
  truth.</p>

  <p>It may naturally be asked how, if all this be so, it is possible that
  we can move about freely in a solid ten thousand million times denser, as
  Sir Oliver Lodge says, than platinum. The obvious answer is that, where
  densities differ sufficiently, they can move through each other with
  perfect freedom; water or air can pass through cloth; air can pass
  through water; an astral form passes unconsciously through a physical
  wall, or through an ordinary human body; many of us have seen an astral
  form walk through a physical, neither being conscious of the passage; it
  does not matter whether we say that a ghost has passed through a wall, or
  a wall has passed through a ghost. A gnome passes freely through a rock,
  and walks about within the earth, as comfortably as we walk about in the
  air. A deeper answer is that consciousness can recognize only
  consciousness, that since we are of the nature of the <font
  class="sc">Logos</font> we can sense only those things which are also of
  His nature. These bubbles are His essence, His life, and, therefore, we,
  who also are part of Him, can see the matter which is built of his
  substance, for all forms are but manifestations of Him. The koilon is to
  us non-manifestation, because we have not unfolded powers which enable us
  to cognise it, and it may be the manifestation of a loftier order of
  <font class="sc">Logoi</font>, utterly beyond our ken.</p>

  <p>As none of our investigators can raise his consciousness to the
  highest plane of our universe, the âdi-tattva plane, it may be of
  interest to explain how it is possible for them to see what may very
  probably be the atom of that plane. That this may be understood it is
  essential to remember that the power of magnification by means of which
  these experiments are conducted is quite apart from the faculty of
  functioning upon one or other of the planes. The latter is the result of
  a slow and gradual unfoldment of the Self, while the former is merely a
  special development of one of the many powers latent in man. All the
  planes are round us here, just as much as any other point in space, and
  if a man sharpens his sight until he can see their tiniest atoms he can
  make a study of them, even though he may as yet be far from the level
  necessary to enable him to understand and function upon the higher planes
  as a whole, or to come into touch with the glorious Intelligences who
  gather those atoms into vehicles for Themselves.</p>

  <p>A partial analogy may be found in the position of the astronomer with
  regard to the stellar universe, or let us say the Milky Way. He can
  observe its constituent parts and learn a good deal about them along
  various lines, but it is absolutely impossible for him to see it as a
  whole from outside, or to form any certain conception of its true shape,
  and to know what it really is. Suppose that the universe is, as many of
  the ancients thought, some inconceivably vast Being, it is utterly
  impossible for us, here in the midst of it, to know what that Being is or
  is doing, for that would mean raising ourselves to a height comparable
  with His; but we may make extensive and detailed examination of such
  particles of His body as happen to be within our reach, for that means
  only the patient use of powers and machinery already at our command.</p>

  <p>Let it not be supposed that, in thus unfolding a little more of the
  wonders of Divine Truth by pushing our investigations to the very
  farthest point at present possible to us, we in any way alter or modify
  all that has been written in theosophical books of the shape and
  constitution of the physical atom, and of the wonderful and orderly
  arrangements by which it is grouped into the various chemical molecules;
  all this remains entirely unaffected.</p>

  <p>Nor is any change introduced as regards the three outpourings from the
  <font class="sc">Logos</font>, and the marvellous facility with which the
  matter of the various planes is by them moulded into forms for the
  service of the evolving life. But if we wish to have a right view of the
  realities underlying manifestation in this universe, we must to a
  considerable extent reverse the ordinary conception as to what this
  matter essentially is. Instead of thinking of its ultimate constituents
  as solid specks floating in a void, we must realise that it is the
  apparent void itself which is solid, and that the specks are but bubbles
  on it. That fact once grasped, all the rest remains as before. The
  relative position of what we have hitherto called matter and force is
  still for us the same as ever; it is only that, on closer examination,
  both of these conceptions prove to be variants of force, the one
  ensouling combinations of the other, and the real "matter," koilon, is
  seen to be something which has hitherto been altogether outside our
  scheme of thought.</p>

  <p>In view of this marvellous distribution of Himself in "space," the
  familiar concept of the "sacrifice of the <font class="sc">Logos</font>"
  takes on a new depth and splendour; this is His "dying in matter," His
  "perpetual sacrifice," and it may be the very glory of the <font
  class="sc">Logos</font> that He can sacrifice Himself to the uttermost by
  thus permeating and making Himself one with that portion of koilon which
  He chooses as the field of His universe.</p>

  <p>What koilon is, what its origin, whether it is itself changed by the
  Divine Breath which is poured into it&mdash;does "Dark Space" thus become
  "Bright Space" at the beginning of a manifestation?&mdash;these are
  questions to which we cannot at present even indicate answers. Perchance
  an intelligent study of the great Scriptures of the world may yield
  replies.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_2" href="#NtA_2">[2]</a> The drawings of the elements were
  done by two Theosophical artists, Herr Hecker and Mrs. Kirby, whom we
  sincerely thank; the diagrams, showing the details of the construction of
  each "element," we owe to the most painstaking labour of Mr.
  Jinarâjadâsa, without whose aid it would have been impossible for us to
  have presented clearly and definitely the complicated arrangements by
  which the chemical elements are built up. We have also to thank him for a
  number of most useful notes, implying much careful research, which are
  incorporated in the present series, and without which we could not have
  written these papers.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_8" href="#NtA_8">[8]</a> A mâyâ, truly.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_9" href="#NtA_9">[9]</a> By a certain action of the will,
  known to students, it is possible to make such a space by pressing back
  and walling off the matter of space.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_10" href="#NtA_10">[10]</a> Again the astral world.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_11" href="#NtA_11">[11]</a> Each spirilla is animated by
  the life-force of a plane, and four are at present normally active, one
  for each round. Their activity in an individual may be prematurely forced
  by yoga practice.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_12" href="#NtA_12">[12]</a> "The ten numbers of the sun.
  These are called Dis&mdash;in reality space&mdash;the forces spread in
  space, three of which are contained in the Sun's Atman, or seventh
  principle, and seven are the rays shot out by the Sun." The atom is a sun
  in miniature in its own universe of the inconceivably minute. Each of the
  seven whorls is connected with one of the Planetary Logoi, so that each
  Planetary Logos has a direct influence playing on the very matter of
  which all things are constructed. It may be supposed that the three,
  conveying electricity, a differentiation of Fohat, are related to the
  Solar Logoi.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_13" href="#NtA_13">[13]</a> The action of electricity
  opens up ground of large extent, and cannot be dealt with here. Does it
  act on the atoms themselves, or on molecules, or sometimes on one and
  sometimes on the other? In soft iron, for instance, are the internal
  arrangements of the chemical atom forcibly distorted, and do they
  elastically return to their original relations when released? and in
  steel is the distortion permanent? In all the diagrams the heart-shaped
  body, exaggerated to show the depression caused by the inflow and the
  point caused by the outflow, is a single atom.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_14" href="#NtA_14">[14]</a> These sub-planes are familiar
  to the Theosophist as gaseous, etheric, super-etheric, sub-atomic,
  atomic; or as Gas, Ether 4, Ether 3, Ether 2, Ether 1.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_15" href="#NtA_15">[15]</a> It must be remembered that the
  diagrams represent three-dimensional objects, and the atoms are not all
  on a plane, necessarily.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_16" href="#NtA_16">[16]</a> That is, the surrounding
  magnetic fields strike on each other.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_17" href="#NtA_17">[17]</a> The fifth member of this group

  <p><a name="Nt_18" href="#NtA_18">[18]</a> This, with references which
  appear later (pp. 32, 33, 50, etc.), relates to articles which appeared
  in the <i>Theosophist</i>, 1908.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_19" href="#NtA_19">[19]</a> Since writing the above I have
  noticed, in the <i>London, Edinburgh and Dublin Philosophical Magazine
  and Journal of Science</i>, conducted by Dr. John Joly and Mr. William
  Francis, in an article entitled "Evolution and Devolution of the
  Elements," the statement that it is probable that in "the nebulous state
  of matter there are four substances, the first two being unknown upon
  earth, the third being hydrogen and the fourth ... helium. It also seems
  probable that ... hydrogen, the two unknown elements, and helium are the
  four original elements from which all the other elements form. To
  distinguish them from the others we will term them protons." This is
  suggestive as regards hydrogen, but does not help us with regard to
  oxygen and nitrogen.</p>

  <p><a name="Nt_20" href="#NtA_20">[20]</a> Theosophists call them
  Nature-Spirits, and often use the mediæval term Elementals. Beings
  concerned with the elements truly are they, even with chemical
  elements.</p>

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org">http://www.gutenberg.org</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
